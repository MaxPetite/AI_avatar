There is no conclusive way to determine when life begins. However, the conclusion is still accurate; the government should still allow abortions. The intricacies of gestation and the vagueness of what defines life make putting a date on it impossible and thus useless for policy making. However, even if life did begin at conception, the mother's bodily autonomy still trumps a fetus's right to life. \nOpinions on when life begins vary widely. Many people believe it starts at conception when the egg is fertilized, initiating gestation. Others argue for gastrulation, the stage where embryonic cells begin to specialize; twins can no longer be formed, and the embryo's identity starts forming. Another viewpoint ties life's beginning to brain development, mainly when brain activity is similar to an adult's. Viability, the stage when a fetus can survive outside the uterus with medical support, is also a key milestone, though its exact timing depends on the advancements in medical technology. Each of these perspectives reflects different beliefs about the definition of life, making a universal agreement challenging due to the lack of a clear, scientifically validated starting point for life.\n\tAnother important note is that many arguments for when life begins also reference the importance of the potential for life. For example, when people argue for fertilization, they say that the embryo has the potential for life, which holds just as much moral weight as actual life. However, this argument falls short when extended. If a fertilized egg has the potential for life, then so should the unfertilized egg and sperm, which would mean that menstruation and any ejaculation for non-fertilization reasons would be murder. That is absurd and invalidates the arguments based on the potential for life.  \n\tThe impossibility of defining when life begins and that potential for life does not hold any bearing means that the first part of the statement is invalid and irrelevant. No definitive scientific or philosophical argument proves that life begins at fertilization, and we do not know enough about what life is to answer that question. Also, the statement says that life begins at conception legally, but that argument is flimsy because it is currently left up to the states to decide that, so it varies from area to area. All of this essentially means that there is no use in trying to decide when life begins, and instead, we should look to another place to decide whether or not abortions should be allowed.\n\tJudith Thompson, in her paper \"A Defense of Abortion,\" avoids debating on when life begins and instead grants for the sake of argument that life does begin at fertilization. This allows Thompson to argue for abortion purely from a bodily autonomy perspective. The traditional pro-life argument that Thompson argues against is this: Every person has a right to life, a fetus is a person, a mother has bodily autonomy, a person's right to life trumps another's bodily autonomy, so a fetus must not be killed, and therefore, abortions must not be performed.\n\tFrom here, Thompson uses an analogy to point out the absurdity of that argument. She proposes a situation where a world-famous violinist is found to have a fatal kidney disease, and his fans have found that you are the only person with the right blood type to save him. So they kidnap you and plug your circulatory system into his. When you wake up, the situation is explained to you, and you are told that it will take nine months for the violinist to survive on his own, but during that time, you have to stay plugged into him. Do you have a moral obligation to stay plugged in?\nThe answer to this analogy is obvious: you do not have to stay plugged in. It is nice to do, but you should not have to. However, if you apply the premises of the pro-life argument laid out earlier, you would be morally required to stay plugged in, as you would be valuing your bodily autonomy over someone else's right to life. This suggests that we do not always value life over autonomy. \n\tAn argument against abortion from Don Marquis's \"Why Abortion is Immoral\" uses a similar strategy to Thompson. He also ignores the whole debate on when life begins and changes the conversation. Marquis defines an idea of \"a future like ours.\" He says the reason people do not kill or harm each other is because it deprives them of a future like ours; everyone deserves to live out their lives like we do. His argument states that because a fetus, no matter when life begins, has a future like ours, and it is always wrong to kill something with a future like ours, then it is immoral to kill a fetus, and abortions should be banned.\n\tThe problem with Marquis's argument is that he is only pretending to avoid the question of when life begins; all he has done is rephrase it to ask when a \"future like ours\" begins. His argument fails in the same way the potential for life argument does; if you accept his argument, you would also have to accept that all sperm and eggs have a future like ours and, therefore, cannot be killed.\n\tThe abortion debate is separate from the unresolved question of life's beginning. With no definitive answer to when life starts, government policy should instead focus on the rights of the living. Prioritizing pregnant individuals' bodily autonomy acknowledges the issue's complexity while respecting existing lives' tangible rights and freedoms. This approach balances ethical considerations without being hindered by the philosophical ambiguity of when life begins."}]}

We should be determined to live for something.\u201d -Winston Churchill. I don't know when I first heard this quote, but whenever I get the feeling of  purposelessness I think of it. I\u2019m not sure why, maybe it\u2019s because I think it's true, what's the point of life if I just go through the motions. Or maybe it's because I don't want it to be true. I don't want the pressure of having to live for something for my life to be \u201cworth\u201d it. There have only been a few times when I really thought about purpose in my life.\n\tI started to think about purpose in 7th grade when we had an assignment on the first day of English to make a drawing that included our hobbies, personality, and anything identity related. First I drew myself, then I drew a couple dogs, a basketball, and a laptop. Then I sat there, trying to think of something else to draw. I saw the people around me who\u2019s papers looked filled or at least had more than three things. I kept thinking, I knew there had to be at least something else that interested me that could count as part of my identity, but for the rest of the class I just sat there adding random detail to the things I already drew. That night I thought I have to find something else that interests me, even if it was something as simple as doodling. Throughout the rest of the school year and the summer I developed a couple other interests. I started playing lacrosse and did a little coding. But neither of those, at least at that point, felt like purpose. Even with my two new hobbies I felt like there was still something missing, that sense of purpose still wasn't there. \n\tBy 8th grade I hadn't thought a whole lot about my purpose until as our final english project we had to make a biography about ourselves, but as if we were 30 years into the future. We had to write about what our career was, how we reached that point, and other achievements. When my teacher first announced this project that sense of purposelessness came back. I had no idea what I wanted my future to be, what job I wanted, let alone how I would get there. I thought through everything I enjoyed, but for each one I couldn't see myself doing it for the rest of my life. I eventually settled on being a comedian because I thought It would be easy to come up with a life story about that, but no part of me actually wanted that to be my future. While I was writing the biography I couldn't help but feel disappointed in myself. I had been alive and doing things for 14 years, by that point there should be something that interested me enough to be my career, but instead I just had a few hobbies that only seemed like place holders for what would eventually be my purpose.\n\tThese two experiences have made me think a lot about purpose, but I still don't have a clear idea of what it is but I do have some thoughts. I\u2019m not religious at all so I don't believe in any grand set in stone purpose for everyone. I do believe that everyone has to find their own purpose, and that has always scared me. In my mind, purpose is finding the thing in life that makes you happy and fulfilled, and when you are about to die you can feel satisfied with the life you lived. As comforting as that idea seems at first, the idea that maybe that won't happen for me is what scares me. What if I never find that thing, that hobby, that career, and end up spending my whole life just looking. What if I think I\u2019ve found that thing but in 30 years I realize it doesn't make me happy and I have wasted half my life for nothing. As depressing as that sounds, there is one thing that gives me hope, this quote from The Catcher in the Rye, \u201cBut what I mean is, lots of time you don't know what interests you most till you start talking about something that doesn't interest you most.\u201d When Holden says this he is talking about a classmate\u2019s speech in his oral expression class. When the classmate starts his speech he seems bored and uninterested. It isn't until he gets asked a couple questions and starts talking about something completely different that he perks up and becomes interested and excited. I think that may be how you find purpose. Maybe you have to just try things and you might just stumble onto your purpose."}]}

Hawthorne introduces Chillingworth as Hester's husband, who only arranged to marry her to have someone to care for him and provide affection. Hester goes to New England before him so she can create a nice home for Chillingworth upon his arrival. When Chillingworth finally arrives and learns of Hester's adultery, Hawthorne instantly portrays him as devious and evil. Hawthorne describes Chillingworth's reaction to seeing Hester as \"A writhing horror twisted itself across his features, like a snake gliding swiftly over them, and making one little pause, with all its wreathed intervolutions\" (42). Hawthorne evokes the image of a snake, which is often associated with evil and slyness. Chillingworth is evil, and Hawthorne makes that evident throughout the book.\nThe only benevolent part of Chillingworth is the persona he puts on in order to hide his evil nature and intentions. Once Chillingworth learns of Hester's sin, his first instinct is to lie about his identity to the community and try to hunt down with whomever Hester has had an affair. The only time Hawthorne presents Chillingworth as good occurs when he acknowledges his responsibility for Hester's sin, saying to her, \"We have wronged each other\u2026I seek no vengeance, plot no evil against thee. Between thee and me, the scale hangs fairly balanced. But, Hester, the man lives who wronged us both!\" (51-52). Chillingworth is a logical man who recognizes the nuance of blame in Hester's sin; however, he shows no sign of considering his decision to get revenge; it is purely an impulsive choice rooted in his evil nature. Chillingworth also knows he needs Hester's trust, so he makes it clear he means no harm. He is not trying to apologize; Chillingworth is protecting his interests. Hawthorne does present Chillingworth as good in the eyes of the community. To them, he is an educated doctor who volunteers to be the town leech out of his goodwill. Chillingworth is only good when it aids his malignant goals. \nChillingworth used to be someone who valued the pursuit of knowledge over everything else; however, his vengeful nature forced him to devote every ounce of his life to his new goal. The title \"leech\" that Chillingworth adopts has another meaning than just the town doctor. He is a leech on Dimmesdale. Chillingworth's goal is to enact revenge on Hester's partner, so once he gets the suspicion that Dimmesdale might be his target, he attaches himself to him, becoming the priest's physician. Then, just like a leech, Chillingworth becomes dependent on Dimmesdale, who has been suffering from the guilt of his affair, and the guilt has begun to manifest as an awful sickness. Chillingworth starts poisoning Dimmesdale under the guise of trying to cure him. From this point on, Chillingworth's sole focus is Dimmesdale; they spend almost every day together. When Chillingworth adopts this goal, \"he chose to withdraw his name from the roll of mankind, and, as regarded his former ties and interests, to vanish out of life completely\" (81). Chillingworth consciously decides to forget and move on from his old life and devote all his resources to revenge. \nChillingworth's sole purpose is vengeance on Dimmesdale, so Chillingworth has no reason to exist when that fails. During their time together, Dimmesdale's well-being continues to decay; meanwhile, Chillingworth remains physically healthy. Chillingworth has absolute power over Dimmesdale; however, this power depends on Dimmesdale's trust. When Dimmesdale learns Chillingworth's true identity and stops accepting the elixirs, Chillingworth loses a significant amount of power, but he still knows Dimmesdale's sin. So, when Dimmesdale publicly announces his sin, he has fully gotten rid of Chillingworth and cast away his leech. Dimmesdale's confession causes Chillingworth to change: \"All his strength and energy - all his vital and intellectual force - seemed at once to desert him; insomuch that he positively, withered up, shriveled away, and almost vanished from mortal sight\" (177). When leeches have no host, they die, which is what Chillingworth does. \nHawthorne crafts an allegory for puritan society throughout The Scarlet Letter; Chillingworth is a vital piece of this allegory; he is the part that proves it impossible. Chillingworth represents the evil and vengeful side everyone tries to hide. He exists purely to torture one man. Chillingworth is the kink in puritan society that they can never work out; he does not thrive despite the society; he thrives because of it. Chillingworth acts precisely like every other puritan; he puts on the guise of being a good person to achieve his ulterior motive. The puritans want to appear as part of the elect for social benefits, and Chillingworth wants to appear as a helpful doctor to enact his revenge. Chillingworth is not different from the puritans; he is one of them, and he is the reason their society will never be sustainable.\n\n\n\n\n\nWork Cited\nHawthorne, Nathaniel. The Scarlet Letter.

I can instantly see which family member they got certain personality traits and quirks from. However, I only looked at myself and my family in the same way once my junior-year English teacher had me generate a list of quirks about myself. That process made it abundantly clear that my half-brother Jack had an undeniable influence on me. \n I have two half-brothers and one half-sister. The youngest, Jack, was six years older than me. Jack and my other half-siblings spent about half their time at their mom's house and the other half with us. Despite the limited time, Jack made sure to hang out with me.\nWhen I was old enough to play video games, I always wanted to challenge Jack to games of FIFA or NHL. Every time he would happily agree before swiftly beating me by at least ten goals. Jack may have never gone easy on me, despite the age difference, but he still made it fun. I mean, there was a reason I continued to challenge him, knowing I would lose. Over the years, I slowly improved, eventually beating Jack for the first time. He didn't take it great, especially because after three straight years of losing, I had a lot of gloating to catch up on. Although he was upset at that moment, he continued playing with me and beating me (that one game was kind of a fluke).\nJack did more than develop my competitive side, though. As a little kid, a big brother is always a role model. I remember always seeing Jack as confident and secure in himself. I'm not sure how much of that was true or just the product of childhood idealization, but whether I meant to or not, I found myself replicating Jack. During car rides, if Jack didn't like a song, I wouldn't either. If Jack thought a movie was funny, so would I. These imitations were somewhat deliberate, I knew I was copying him, but I didn't understand why at the time. However, some things I picked up from Jack were much more subtle but more indicative of his influence on me. \nOne night, when I was fifteen, we were having a family dinner. I brought up how this girl in my grade kept making a fuss whenever I said, \"Uh huh.\" I didn't even notice it till she pointed it out, and then, I couldn't help but see it myself. Jack was the first to speak up after I was done talking. He shared how his coworkers did the same thing to him. He said, \"It's my way of responding to someone without actually engaging in conversation.\" And that's when it clicked. That's precisely why I was using it too. It was not like I was intentionally being dismissive or trying to avoid them; it just kinda happened. I didn't pick up \"uh huh\" from Jack, but the attitude that led to it was all Jack.\nOne of the shows I started watching because of Jack was \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.\" He introduced it to me when I was eleven-ish, and I have been watching it on and off since then. It's a great show, but there was something I didn't notice until Jack mentioned it a while back. The characters in the show say \"Heyo\" quite a bit. Jack has been saying it forever, and I picked it up from him. I never connected it to the show because I was so used to us saying it. \nI remember once during sophomore year, I was driving with a friend, and he said \"Heyo\" in response to something. He picked it up from me but used it all wrong. He asked me to explain it, which made me realize that I didn't have a concrete understanding of when to use it either. The best I could explain was it's something I say when I want to acknowledge something someone said or agree with them. Like, if someone makes a clever joke that's not exactly a belly laugh but still deserves a nod, I'll drop a \"Heyo.\"\nLooking back, even though I didn't spend a lot of time with Jack as a kid, there's no doubt in my mind that I'd be a different person today without him. Although I see Jack even less frequently now, every time I call out \"heyo\" or sidestep boring conversations with an \"uh huh,\" I know at least part of me is a direct echo of him.\n\n\u201cIn Pursuit of Authenticity\u201d\nFor my whole life, I've struggled with the idea of authenticity. Being genuinely authentic was never something I could picture myself being. The idea of not holding any part of myself back and letting other people see me for all the things I didn't like about myself was so out of the question and scary that it never even occurred to me. However, I didn't always have this problem.\nWhen I was a young kid, I just existed. I did the things I loved, said whatever came to mind, all without caring at all about what others thought. Trying new sports, messing up, it didn't matter to me. But growing up changed something. Maybe it was the internet, or perhaps just understanding more about people and the world. Suddenly, I felt others' eyes on me in a way I'd never experienced. I overthought each conversation, worrying if I'd said the right thing, if I was odd, or worse, if I'd made someone uncomfortable. This fear of making others uncomfortable even stopped me from talking at all sometimes. I yearned for the confident, happy kid I used to be, but didn't know how to overcome these deep insecurities. It wasn't until the summer before freshman year, while I was backpacking in Alaska that things began to shift.\nOver most of middle school and high school, I have been privileged enough to go on backpacking trips in the summer with a company called Wilderness Adventures.I have gone on a few of these trips; however, when I went on a backpacking trip in Alaska before freshman year, something clicked in my head. All my trips have been two weeks long and usually only consisted of three to four days of actual backcountry backpacking; however, this Alaska trip had six days of backpacking in which we would cover sixty-five miles. Part of me was nervous about the increased challenge, but I knew I was physically capable. \nThe trip started with the required superficial introductions and icebreakers, but to me the trip truly starts on the first day of backpacking. The first day on the trail is always tough; your feet and shoes aren't entirely broken in, and you are still used to the luxury of bathrooms. To make matters worse, it started to rain about a mile from our camp. Everyone ran -- or as close to running as you can get with 40 pounds on your back -- to the site. \nUsually, when you finally make it to the campsite each day, you fall back onto your pack, unbuckle all your straps, and lie there for a minute. You let yourself decompress and then take off your shoes, switch into your comfy camp shoes, and then after plenty of relaxing, you set up your tent with your tent mates. However, because the rain was coming down so hard and the temperature was starting to drop, we didn't have any time to relax. My tentmate and I scrambled to get our tent pieces out of our packs and assembled the thing while trying to keep it somewhat dry. At last, I had a moment to return to my pack and dig out my warmest clothes and a rain jacket and pants. At that point, everything I was wearing was soaked, and my only option was to just be cold and wet while everything dried under my rain layers. \nAfter everyone sat in their tents for a while to dry off, the cooking crew for that day had to go back outside and brave the rain to make dinner. Everyone else went out to keep them company, despite it still being fifteen degrees and raining. Luckily, the camp stove we had was able to work in the rain. Despite its purpose being mainly for cooking, it also emitted just enough heat to make us a little warmer. So, there we all were, nine teenagers and two adults, all wrapped up in warm clothes crouching and huddling around a pot of cooking beans, talking about how miserable and cold we were.\nI had only known these people for less than three days, and we had already gone through a lot. It was these moments of genuine human connection that felt so pure and new to me. It was these moments that changed my way of thinking.\n I've always loved how being in the backcountry strips away the superficial layers people wear, especially myself. It's hard to not be vulnerable and authentic with people when you are hiking ten miles a day and sleeping in the same small tent with them all while not showering. I love the person I become out there. I love how I never look in a mirror because there simply isn't a mirror to look at. I love how I wear the same outfit for five days straight because who will judge me. I love how I freely talk about anything on my mind because when you are out hiking for nine hours a day, what else are you going to do? I love how I get out of the tent early in the morning to watch the sunrise. I love how despite my aches, pains, and blisters, I still muster up the strength to keep going. I love how I stay up late around a campfire and talk about things I would never even imagine discussing anywhere else. I had felt all of this before, but never as intensely as I did there, huddled around the stove, and that's when it really clicked for me. \nAfter that trip ended and I went back home, I knew I was no longer that person in the backcountry I loved so much, but I knew he was inside me. I at least knew I was capable of that type of authenticity I didn't even know was possible before. That has allowed me to start working towards achieving that authenticity even outside the context of backpacking."}]}

All the little things that had to happen. The millions of years of ancestors, all the way back to single cells in a pond, my grandparents meeting, my parents finding each other at work and getting married. It's a statistical anomaly that I exist the way I do, at existential and biological levels. The odds of any one sperm becoming a person are unimaginably low. And the fact that it was the one unique sperm with its DNA that made it, which now wholly defines me, seems impossible. All that thinking has convinced me that people are the product of their biology and environment, which has led me to become a determinist. Determinism is simply the idea that our future is predetermined and that if we reset the entire universe, every event would happen exactly as it already has. I would end up right back here writing this essay. Some people believe in determinism for religious reasons, but I think it's simply the nature of who we are.\nPeople often seem incredibly complex, but when I look at humans, especially myself, and try to really understand why we are who we are, the list of factors that could be affecting us seems nearly infinite. I can't stop thinking about how my decisions are influenced by previous decisions and aspects outside my control. Even things so core to my identity, like my atheism, political beliefs, and sense of humor, are direct results of the people and environments I've been raised around. My family has only ever practiced religion through holidays; my parents have always openly discussed politics and allowed me to have my own beliefs, and my four siblings and I have always teased and joked around with each other. I wonder what would have happened had I been born as an only child to a devoutly religious family; such core parts of my identity would likely be wildly different. So are those identities part of me or just byproducts of the conditions I was in.\nOne implication of my belief in determinism is that it leaves no room for free will, which is weird to think about. Free will is an assumption required for everything: individualism, capitalism, the justice system, and our understanding of ourselves and others. Without free will, our whole system falls apart, which is precisely the stance of many determinists like myself. Our world has been designed unfairly: virtues and achievements have been given too much value while the effects of our biology and environments have been largely ignored.\nI've always taken some pride in my academic success during high school. I tried hard, I learned how to work through my learning disability, and I did extra when I didn't have to. But, because I believe in determinism, I have to accept that maybe I was only capable of that because I was born to a wealthy family who had the resources to tutor me at a young age, pay for private education, and give me the security to only ever have to worry about school. How much of it was really me? Am I unique, or would any kid given the same opportunity have done the same? Or maybe my brain was predisposed to succeed in our institutions, and other kids weren't so fortunate. \nAccepting that I can only credit my circumstances for any successes I've had takes me back to my point from earlier. Our society puts so much value on those successes; that's what capitalism is built on: the idea that anyone has the same opportunity to prosper, no matter their situation. By reframing everything from the determinism perspective, we can have more sympathy for those who have succeeded and maybe design a better system for everyone.  \nI've been thinking about determinism for a while. Still, I've thought about it more this year and attribute it to the whole college process. Doing college applications is a really strange form of self-reflection. You have to compile a set of essays, grades, tests, and activities that are supposed to tell every college everything about you. The worst part is that it largely defines at least the next four years of your life. So, during the whole process of making the application, you have to think about how all your past choices about which sports to play, which tests to study extra hard for, which clubs to join, and how to spend your free time will affect the next four years of your life. And then add on my belief in determinism, and it all starts to seem arbitrary; does one person really deserve to get into one college more than another if the things being considered are entirely out of their control. \nAlong with that self-reflection, I've discovered a weird type of guilt, and maybe guilt isn't quite the right word, but it's not completely wrong. Part of me feels guilty about having things so good. There are people all over the world experiencing extreme poverty and all sorts of tragedies, and here I am, worrying about free will and determinism. I think I would describe my guilt as a sort of predictive guilt. I'm worried I will waste the incredible advantages I was born into, and the only way to overcome this guilt is to do something meaningful with the conditions I've been given."}]}

Much like mastering a new language, it requires practice and patience. The process begins with recognizing the basic elements, the letters, and the small details that form the foundation. From there, one must learn the grammar, syntax, and context, linking these elements into cohesive units and interpreting their surroundings to discern their significance. Over time, this skill becomes instinctual, as natural as speaking your native language. Immersion is key to genuinely becoming fluent in the language of beauty. My four backpacking trips during middle and high school provided me with an immersive experience, each teaching me more about the subtle art of seeing beauty in the world around me.\nMy first trip was to Jackson Hole, Wyoming. I was just twelve years old and was the youngest one on the trip. The backpacking was relatively easy in hindsight, but it seemed nearly impossible as a kid who hadn't ever hiked more than a few miles with someone else carrying my things. I remember the first day was particularly challenging, and I wasn't in the best mood when we got to our camp, but that night, my group and I circled the flickering fire off the bank of the rushing river just a few feet away. It was in that moment, as I began to focus on the symphony of embers popping off the fire, crickets chirping in the nearby woods, water crashing into and eroding the rocky river bed, and the soft chatter of new friends that I began to see the letters of beauty first. The next morning, I was more excited for our day of hiking, and over those 9 miles that day, I noticed more letters: the sound each person's footsteps made as they collided with the trail, the wind rushing through the leafy trees, and the collective sigh when we took breaks. It was these little things, little pieces of beauty, that, while I didn't consciously appreciate, made the whole trip so much better.\nMy Oregon trip was when I began to learn the grammar. This trip was more intense than my first; it was fifty miles to the base of the mountain we were going to summit. This was daunting; I knew I could do it physically, but I needed more confidence in whether I had the sheer willpower. When we first started hiking, all I could think about was the summit coming up and how difficult that climb would be. I found myself getting lost in those thoughts. It was in these moments of doubt that the structure began to become apparent. It was the night before the summit that I could piece together all those letters I had found in Wyoming. We had gotten to the base camp earlier that day; we did all our usual camp stuff: setting up tents, making dinner, laying down, and hanging out. However, this afternoon was a little different than most as we had to prepare for the summit; luckily, it was just a day summit, so we got to leave our heavy packs behind and bring smaller day packs, so we stuffed those with our lunches, water filters, plenty of layers, and some extra snacks. Then, we were instructed to go to bed early because we had to wake up at 4 a.m. to ensure enough time for the summit. That night, all we could talk about was the climb and its difficulty; we all joked that we could just skip it. So, as we climbed into our tent, I couldn't get my doubts out of my head, and I found myself struggling to sleep. \nAfter a while of tossing and turning, I just decided I needed to walk around. I quietly wiggled out of my sleeping bag, unzipped the door, slipped my shoes on, grabbed my camp chair, and began walking down to the lake at the mountain's base. We had all gone and jumped in the freezing lake earlier after our backpacking to freeze the aches out of our feet, but now, at night, I was the only one down there. I found what looked like the most comfortable spot on the rocky beach and set up my chair. I sat there for a minute, staring at the soft reflections of moonlight on the lake, fidgeting with a few rocks in my hands, and trying not to think about anything. I started to see those letters again: the erosion lines across the entire mountain, the altitude where trees can no longer grow, and the mountain fully reveals itself, the subtle ripples in the water as little bugs flew around, and the sounds of rocks shifting as I adjusted my weight in my chair. But I also began noticing something else; the pieces came together, ceased being separate, and I began to understand them as a whole. I thought about how the water that carved the mountain was now settled in this lake; the rocks I played with were once pieces of the mountain; the trees had dictated the water flow and housed many of the bugs and animals that now caused ripples in the lake. It was all connected, it all made sense, it was all beautiful. I tried to decide where I fit in, what effect I had, and what I influenced. I couldn't find an answer, but now, a part of me thought I just needed to see more; I needed to reach the top of that mountain.\nLearning one sentence of another language is relatively easy, but fluency certainly is. I had read the language of beauty at that moment in Oregon, but I was not fluent. I knew there was more out there; I wondered how much I had missed in the past simply because I had not realized what to look for. I tried to practice whenever I could, but it's much easier out in the backcountry than anywhere else. So, it was not until my next trip to Alaska that I could keep learning. This was my favorite trip because of the incredible location and because I now knew how to appreciate it. I struggled a lot less on this trip, which I largely attribute to my understanding of the beauty I was lucky enough to be experiencing; it is much easier to enjoy yourself when you recognize the beauty all around you. \nAfter all my trips, I've become fluent in beauty, but I know I could still be so much better. The hardest part is trying to keep working at it outside of my trips and trying to find the letters and meaning in my everyday life. The biggest realization I've had was that beauty appears very differently. Instead of coming from running water, blowing wind, and looming mountains, I've found it in the people around me. The meaningless conversations that all I can remember from are the belly laughs, the moments when a friend has saved me a seat at a table, bonding over a shared annoyance, being sent a song a friend thinks I would like, and being comfortable enough with someone to sit in silence. I couldn't have learned how to notice and appreciate everything I do now without my experiences in the wilderness and the adversity that forced me to find beauty in something that initially seemed awful. I hope that as I continue to practice and learn the language of beauty, I can help others who struggle to understand how to see the letters, piece them together, and finally become fluent."}]}

Shakespeare combines these moments and juxtaposes the emotions of love and violence to remind us of their power and intersection.\nBeatrices and Benedict\u2019s confession of love is very sweet at first and starkly contrasts the betrayal of love that just took place between Claudio and Hero. It is in this respite of love that Shakespeare chooses to remind us that love is an irrational and intense emotion that will often cloud our judgment. Once the two admit their love, Beatrice asks Benidict to kill Claudio, avenging Hero, to prove his love. Benedict is initially hesitant but quickly changes his mind for Beatrice. Shakespeare makes it clear that it is his love for Beatrice that convinces him to kill his best friend, not any kind of change in feeling for Claudio. It is also not only romantic love that has this effect: Beatrice also very quickly decides Claudio needs to die because of her familial love for Hero. Whether or not Claudio deserves to die, Benedict and Beatrice quickly make the decision to kill him in a moment of love.\nThis scene also plays off the title \u201cMuch Ado About Nothing\u201d. We usually don't give much value to love stories, at least in comparison to dramas and tragedies, but Shakespeare seems to be suggesting that the two are more closely connected than separate. In his story that is supposably about nothing, just love, quickly takes a turn toward utter violence during what should be the most love filled event: a wedding. He continues to play off this by rooting the violence in Benedict's love for Beatrice and Beatrice\u2019s love for Hero. Love and violence may feel entirely separate, but they are both incredibly strong and consuming emotions that often intersect."}]}

The diversity and nuance in human nature make it even more remarkable that we come together to form these pockets of belonging. The most impactful communities assemble themselves effortlessly; they are the ones you find yourself part of before you even realize it. There's a moment full of peace and self-assurance when you recognize this belonging. It's a sensation illustrated in Jhumpa Lahiri's short story \"In the Sun.\"\n\tIn her short story, Lahiri paints a picture of a bustling morning in her Italian neighborhood. The air is thick with the promise of spring; it's \"the first warm day,\" and the mood is joyful as if the community has thrown \"a party effortlessly organized at the last minute.\" She walks into a local shop, where the smell of freshly baked bread fills the air and buys a sandwich. Then she settles into a park bench, alone yet deeply connected to the world around her. As she watches people of all ages enjoying the sun, she realizes she doesn't \"feel even slightly alone.\" It's a serene and comforting moment, one where she grasps the unspoken strength of her community, a strength so potent that solitude feels like an embrace rather than isolation.\nWhen I first read Lahiri's story, my mind instantly transported me back to the fourth day of my wilderness adventure in Utah. We were navigating the white-capped rapids 50 miles deep into an 80-mile journey through steep canyons. Our group had 13 people: 10 campers and 3 leaders. Even though we had known each other for just a few days, the unrelenting sun, the intense paddling, and the often too-cozy tents had bonded us into a community.\nOn that fourth morning, I woke up while the rest of the camp was still deep in their well-earned sleep. Tiptoeing to avoid waking my tentmates, I slipped into my fleece jacket, grabbed my Nalgene bottle and camp chair, and began my solitary trek toward the towering canyon wall. My hands felt the coarse texture of ancient boulders as I climbed, each rock a testament to millions of years of erosion. When I finally found a spot that felt right, I unfolded my camp chair and settled in. By then, it was about 6 a.m.\nFrom this elevated perch, my eyes took in the full view of our temporary home, the tents like tiny islands in a sea of stone and long grass, our fire pit surrounded by a ring of chairs, and our rafts beached on the rocky shore like slumbering sea creatures. I sat, enveloped in the stillness, the only sound being the distant murmur of the river. As the sun began to rise, casting golden rays of light over the opposite canyon wall, the camp started to stir. One by one, my fellow adventurers emerged from their nylon homes, donning jackets and stretching limbs. I watched as the day's cooking crew moved toward the kitchen area, the first sizzle of breakfast mingling with the crisp morning air. Gradually, the hushed tones of sleepy conversation filled the camp.\nAt that moment, perched above yet deeply connected, I felt it, the same serenity Lahiri describes. I had physically removed myself from the group, but some part of me was right there among them. I was by myself but not lonely, content in my solitude, full of the knowledge that I was part of something bigger. I didn't \"feel even slightly alone.\"\n\tThese moments of profound community connection are rare and elusive, often going unnoticed even as we experience them. It's easy to overlook these fleeting moments, to brush them off as byproducts of the situation or setting. But they're far more than that; they're what it means to belong, to feel part of and apart from a group.\nI never fully understood the emotional weight of what I felt that morning on the canyon rocks until I read Lahiri's vivid depiction. Her story served as a lens, bringing into focus the hidden truth of my story. It made me realize that these moments are more than just nice experiences; they are milestones in our understanding of ourselves and our communities. \nLahiri's intentions go beyond just description. She wants us to be more observant, to cherish these moments and the unique communities that create them. In doing so, we not only gain some wonderful and serene moments, but we also advance our understanding of community. These moments, these brief bubbles of peace and self-assurance, remind us of the beauty and power in human connection."}]}

I think this human flaw is difficult to overcome.  People are by nature pattern driven animals; we live within daily routines and primarily interact with the same people daily. These patterns are comforting; they bring security in being able to predict how any given day will go, so we actively seek them. However, when we seek patterns, repetition, and predictability too often our lives start to stagnate, and all of these pieces that make up our everyday patterns become a given. \n\tWhen I wake up in the morning, it\u2019s certain that I will be able to drink a coffee and eat breakfast. I\u2019m never worried that my school won\u2019t be safe to go to. During the day, it\u2019s a given that I will have classes from a great teacher and plenty of food for lunch. When I get home, I know I\u2019ll get a warm home cooked meal and be able to spend time with my family. I can describe with near certainty how any day of my week will go, which is comforting; however, it also means that the access to food, safety, education, and a loving family that I\u2019m lucky enough to have has become my normal. This can lead me to not appreciate the people who provide those things as much as I should. This kind of pattern and routine is somewhat exaggerated for me because I\u2019m a student, but it exists outside that world as well. \n\tIn \u201cPlease Look After Mom,\u201d Kyung-sook Shin teaches us to recognize this flaw in human nature and learn to appreciate the people in our lives before it\u2019s too late. Shin gives us the perspective of So-Nyo\u2019s children and husband after she goes missing in a train station in Seoul due to cognitive health issues. This book doesn\u2019t really have a traditional plot. In fact, exactly what happened to So-Nyo after she went missing is never revealed. The children do search for her, but mostly in their own minds.\n\tShin takes us into the memories of So-Nyo\u2019s family. Having just lost her, the kids and husband reflect on all the times they ignored her, fought with her, didn\u2019t say thanks, and refused to reciprocate the care she gave them. They all feel deeply guilty and blame themselves for not truly recognizing So-Nyo\u2019s health problems and not doing anything to help her. They all recall her suffering from migraines, but that had just always been the case, part of their routine, so they never took it seriously. Chi-hon similarly always read her older brother\u2019s letters from college to her mom but never realized this was because she was illiterate. The neglect of So-Nyo from the family is awful, but not unique.\n\tIn Shin\u2019s effort to make us realize how we often similarly neglect our own loved ones, she wrote the entire book in the second person. Since the book is also a series of memories and reflections, we get an interesting juxtaposition of personal stories and impersonal writing, which changes how the reader understands the text. Instead of reading someone's inner thoughts, it feels like we are the characters and are being spoken to and condemned by some outside force. It feels as if we are being accused of everything the characters have done. Shin takes the contempt we feel for the characters\u2019 actions, flips it back on us, and forces us to consider ourselves instead of just judging the character.\n\tThe lesson of \u201cPlease Look After Mom\u201d seems extra relevant right now for my senior class and me. We are about to leave the familiar, go away from our comfortable routines and patterns that have been cemented for years. With this change will come an appreciation for the things and people we took for granted that existed within those patterns. I know I will miss having home cooked family meals most nights, so I will make sure my parents understand how much I appreciate them for that. I know I will miss hundreds more things that I can\u2019t even begin to imagine until I step outside my comfortable patterns, so all I can do is let people know I appreciate what they do, and try whenever I can to reciprocate the care I\u2019ve received."}]}

This continuity, while convenient, can obscure the gradual changes we undergo in both identity and purpose. Because these alterations are incremental, we often overlook how different we become over time. In Slaughterhouse-Five, Kurt Vonnegut challenges this perception by introducing us to Billy Pilgrim, who experiences his life in a fragmented, non-linear fashion. Through Billy's disjointed timeline, Vonnegut highlights the drastic shifts in purpose and identity that people undergo throughout their lives. Two of the main roles Billy fills are that of a World War II soldier and a philosopher.\nDuring his time in World War II, specifically in the aftermath of the Battle of the Bulge, Billy Pilgrim finds himself disoriented and stranded behind enemy lines. He's part of a small group of American soldiers, all similarly lost but better equipped for survival. In this precarious situation, Vonnegut vividly captures Billy's existential void, describing him as \"empty-handed, bleakly ready for death.\" At this moment, Billy is not a soldier or a hero; he is barely alive and simply waiting for death to find him. Unlike his companions, he carries no weapon, no supplies, and seems devoid of the will to fight or flee. The only reason Billy stays with the group is that one of the other soldiers believes he will be labeled a war hero if he leads someone as weak and pathetic as Billy through enemy lines. Billy's purpose, if one can even call it that, is survival, though even this is marked by a bleak readiness to accept death as an end. This stage of Billy's life paints a picture of a man disconnected from the world around him, marching without a destination, fighting without a cause. His identity is almost entirely swallowed by the chaos of war, leaving behind a shell of a person who is \"bleakly ready\" for the end.\nIn the years following World War II, Billy Pilgrim undergoes a significant transformation, heavily influenced by his claimed experiences on Tralfamadore, an alien planet where time is perceived all at once rather than linearly. No longer the empty vessel \"bleakly ready for death,\" Billy now embraces the role of a public speaker and philosopher, driven to share his newfound wisdom derived from Tralfamadorian philosophy. In one of his speeches\u2014real or imagined\u2014he asserts, \u201cIf you protest, if you think that death is a terrible thing, then you have not understood a word I\u2019ve said,\u201d concluding with the cryptic phrase: \u201cFarewell, hello, farewell, hello.\u201d These words encapsulate Billy's new purpose: to share an understanding of time and existence that defies conventional human thought.\nThis shift in Billy's identity and purpose is vast. He transitions from an essentially purposeless shell of a person merely surviving to someone with a clear idea of who he is, what he believes, and what he wants to do with his life, even if it seems incredibly unusual. Vonnegut does not present this change to the reader linearly, just as Billy does not experience it linearly. Instead, in the context of the narrative, Billy is at all moments both the soldier and the philosopher. Vonnegut also does not try to make these changes subtle; he jumps between time periods at a whim, and it is often unclear which version of Billy is being shown with each jump. This serves to highlight just how incredible these changes are because, if they were viewed linearly with all the subtle growth required along the way, they would seem less drastic.\nSlaughterhouse-Five uses Billy's unique experience of life to remind us that our identities and purposes are malleable and ever-changing. From Billy's perspective, these things can literally change from moment to moment, but for regular people, Vonnegut is telling us to recognize how much we have changed by reflecting on our past selves while also experiencing the present."}]}

In Arthur Miller's play The Crucible, the idea of \"mob mentality\" is heavily present in the events of the Salem witch trials. The concept of \"mob mentality\" refers to the tendency of individuals to conform to the opinions and beliefs of the group they are a part of, often disregarding their own beliefs and morals in the process. This conformity can lead to irrational and dangerous actions. \"Mob mentality\" provides the means for the witch trials in The Crucible; it causes people to lie, be manipulated, and accept baseless accusations of witchcraft, which allows for the many killings.\nOne of the key ways \"mob mentality\" is evident in The Crucible is in the behavior of the young girls who accuse others of witchcraft. When one girl, Betty, falls into a strange illness, the other girls begin to act in strange ways as well. Abigail, who is jealous of Elizabeth Proctor and wants to get rid of her, begins to accuse others of being witches. The other girls quickly follow suit, even though there is no evidence to support their accusations. This behavior is a clear example of \"mob mentality\" at work. The group's beliefs and desires influence the girls, and they conform to those beliefs to fit in and avoid accusations from said group. After Betty wakes up and begins talking about how Abigail drank blood, Abigail tells Betty and Mary Warren, \"Let either of you breathe a word, or the edge of a word, about the other things, and I will come to you in the black of some terrible night and I will bring a pointy reckoning that will shudder you\" (19). The fear and pressure from the group make the girls willing to lie and persecute others to protect themselves. Abigail knows she has power over these girls and weaponizes it for her gain. Abigail's ability to wield the \"mob mentality\" is seen again later in the courthouse after John Proctor accuses Abigail of being a whore. Abigail changes the topic by pretending to be possessed by Mary Warren, saying, \"Oh, Mary, this is a black art to change your shape. No, I cannot, I cannot stop my mouth; it's God's work I do.\" (107) Abigail starts acting like she is possessed and that Mary Warren has projected her spirit as a bird. Immediately after Abigail starts this act, all the other girls quickly follow and seem to honestly believe they are also possessed. Aside from Abigail, none of these girls are explicitly seeking some malignant goal; the hysteria of the witch trials and Abigail's manipulation have just swept them up.\nAnother way \"mob mentality\" is evident in The Crucible is in the townspeople's reactions to the accusations of witchcraft. When the girls first begin to accuse others, the town is skeptical and unwilling to believe them. However, as the allegations continue and the court has more and more people arrested, the townspeople become caught up in the frenzy. They begin to believe in the girls' accusations, and they start to accuse others themselves. The town's reaction is again an example of \"mob mentality\" at work. The group's beliefs and the fear of being accused influence the townspeople, who then conform to those beliefs to fit in and avoid punishment. As Reverend Hale says while investigating John and Elizabeth, \"No man may longer doubt the powers of the dark are gathered in monstrous attack upon this village. There is too much evidence now to deny it\" (61). Even Reverend Hale, someone who eventually recognizes the absurdity of the trials, is initially convinced. The hysteria and fear of the status quo being disturbed causes even intelligent and well-meaning people to believe and act on absurdities.\n\t\"Mob mentality\" plays a significant role in modern society. It is easy to look back on the actions of dead puritans and see how blatantly wrong and baseless their actions were. From a modern perspective, these puritans lacked basic critical thinking skills and failed to demand evidence for accusations. However, the motivations of these people are similar to modern ones. Most people, on a fundamental level, are concerned with their well-being and preserving the status quo when it benefits them. These motivations are precisely what these puritans were acting on; they knew they could either accuse or be accused, kill or be killed, and from that perspective, their actions make more sense. The effect of \"mob mentality\" also plays directly into this idea. It is much easier to succumb to these motivations when everyone else in the community is as well. It is easier to believe things like witchcraft when everyone else thinks it is accurate. Modern society has plenty of \"mob mentality.\" From political groups, online communities, and social groups, people often find themselves accusing and harassing others over minor differences. It is essential always to be aware of \"mob mentalities\"; although they are difficult to avoid, knowing they exist and their effect can help prevent their potentially dangerous consequences."}]}

They are his favorite breakfast food, so we always make him a batch on Father's Day. One Father's Day, when I was six, my Mom woke my sister and me up early to ensure we had time to write cards and make the muffins. It was a calm morning with my Mom baking and my sister and me sitting at our kitchen table writing. After a while, it was time to put the muffins into the oven, and I decided I had to go to the bathroom real bad. During this period of my life, I had a habit of running everywhere in our house so I could slide across the hardwood on my socks once I picked up enough speed. My Mom knew this, so when she saw me get up from the table, she told me to walk the other way around our kitchen so I didn't run into the open oven door. Now, I was, for the most part, a decent kid, so I listened and did my running and sliding on a different path to get to the bathroom. I successfully used the bathroom, and I guess while I was in the bathroom, I had decided that my Mom was probably all done with the oven and had closed it. Operating on that assumption, I figured I was free to sprint down the hallway into our kitchen. So I flew open the bathroom door, made a sharp turn around the corner, and entered an all-out sprint down the hallway. Unfortunately, the same socks that allowed me to slide so far also prevented me from stopping myself.\n\tConsequently, as I sped down the hallway and noticed that the oven door was not, in fact, closed and that it happened to be at the exact height of my head, I was incapable of doing anything about it. I smacked right into the door and then smashed right onto the floor. The door hit me right between my eyes, and the blood was pouring out. My Mom, who hadn't seen me actually hit the oven but sure did hear the thud and all the crying, went into parent mode. She quickly ran upstairs to get my Dad, who had already been awakened by my screaming and rushed me over to the ER. So, my Dad didn't get to eat his blueberry muffins and spent his whole Father's day sitting in the ER worrying that his son might have lost an eyeball. Luckily, I had avoided losing an eye, but it sure was close."}]}

So, one day my mom told me I needed to shower. She brings me to her bathroom, turns the shower on, and throws a few random toys in there. I get in the shower, and like usual, I just hang out and play with the cups for a while. Eventually, I realize I need to use the bathroom, and not number one, so because I'm just a stupid little five-year-old, I go right in the shower. Then, my stupid little five-year-old brain makes a grand realization, my own poop would make a great toy and an impressive one at that. My next thought is, I bet my mom would find this really cool.

She bends down, sticks her hand out, and lets me give her whatever \"toy\" I thought she needed to see. It isn't until she fully grabs the poop from my hand that she realizes what she is holding. She suddenly recoils, drops the shit, and runs to the sink in her bathroom. Meanwhile, I had no idea what was happening; in my mind, I had just shown my mom a really cool toy, and for some reason, she didn't like it as much as me."}]}

Over the next four years, the economy went on to completely crash; banks failed, and unemployment skyrocketed. It was not until 1939 and the start of World War II that America pulled itself out of the Great Depression. In 1932 Franklin D. Roosevelt ran his presidential campaign on the promise of a New Deal, a set of programs and policies that would pull America out of the depression. His New Deal was considered radical because the consensus then was that the government should stay out of the economy, but things were so bad that people were ready for change. After being elected, Roosevelt had what is now considered the most prolific first one hundred days of any president. As he pushed out new programs and laws, it is hard to answer how effective the New Deal was for curing the Great Depression. However, it is possible to answer how the New Deal affected African Americans. How did the New Deal affect African Americans and segregation?\nRoosevelt's New Deal mainly targeted a few different areas: housing, employment, and unions. On the surface, most of his programs seem to have been generally good and helpful for those who believe the government should have an active role in the economy. However, when looking closer at the finer details, obviously racist and harmful patterns emerge. Through unions, employment, and housing, the New Deal systematically left African Americans behind in the push to fix the economy and consequently increased institutionalized segregation.\nTo demonstrate my thesis, the context of the Great Depression must be given first. Secondly, I will show how African Americans were discriminated against by unions even when employed through the National Labor Relation Act. Next, I will cover how African Americans were held back in employment opportunities by the Civilian Conservation Corps and the National Recovery Administration. Lastly, I will discuss the effect of the Public Works Administration, the United States Housing Authority, the Home Owners Loan Corporation, and the Federal Housing Administrations had on African American housing and segregation. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow the New Deal Affected African Americans and Segregation\n\nIn 1929 the Great Depression began, and the American economy collapsed. After four years of unprecedented recession, it ended, but the economy was still very weak. Industrial production had fallen 47%, GDP went down 30%, and unemployment was the worst it had ever been at around 20%. This rapid drop in the economy meant people were less likely to invest and generally spend money. Without consumer spending and investment the economy became stagnant. This cycle created a situation in America that made people ready for radical change. \nThe common thought before the Great Depression was that the government should stay out of the economy, but the Great Depression was so harsh that people realized something had to change. Providing change was the idea Franklin D. Roosevelt ran on in 1932. He said he had a radical New Deal for America that would pull it out of the Great Depression. Despite leaving the details of his New Deal vague, he was still elected. He proceeded to very quickly stick to his promise and push out new programs and policies, all to create new jobs, finance mortgages and get people housed, and improve working conditions. However, in his fight to get these changes out, he had to make many compromises. \nOne major compromise was with the Southern Democrats. To get his bills through the Senate, he needed the support of the Southern Democrats who strongly believed in white supremacy. This meant that when bills had to be amended to pass, it was usually because the Southern Democrats wanted as little if not no benefits going to African Americans. Due to Southern Democrats and the racism that already existed in America, many of Roosevelt's New Deal programs excluded if not actively hurt African Americans.\nFor example, Roosevelt\u2019s labor programs did not help African Americans. In 1935 Roosevelt signed the National Labor Relations Act, which gave unions with the support of enough workers the right to bargain with management at construction and factory sites. This change allowed workers and their unions to negotiate contracts that would cover all employees. This was a significant step in the right direction for giving more power to the working class; however, it was nowhere near perfect. When the bill was first written, it included a clause that stated that only unions that allowed African Americans would be granted this collective bargaining power. The American Federation of Labor did not support this clause and lobbied the senator who originally proposed the bill to remove it, and it worked. The clause was removed, and the bill passed. \nThe National Labor Relations Act also prevented the agriculture and domestic industries, both predominantly African American, from forming unions. This exclusion made it difficult for black workers to unionize. At this point, less than 1% of all union workers were African American, so these majority white, if not all white, unions suddenly had a lot more leverage and were not always using it for good. In some cases, the segregated unions would force companies to fire African Americans employed before unionization. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which was assigned to oversee the act, allowed this to happen. In fact, in New York, an NLRB certified Building Service Employees Union exercised its collective bargaining. It forced Manhattan hotels, restaurants, and offices to fire their African American restaurant workers and elevator operators. These jobs were to be filled by whites. Even when African Americans could find work, they were systematically deprived from the benefits unions granted their white counterparts and sometimes even fired merely because all-white union members wanted their jobs.\nAfrican Americans were also excluded from New Deal employment programs designed to put America back to work. The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was founded in 1933 to employ people and teach them the skills to find better jobs. This was a great idea. If the unemployed could get employed and learn new skills to find better-paying jobs, they could start spending more money right away, and eventually even more later, which would stimulate the economy. However, this was not the story for African Americans. Across the country, the residential camps that corps members lived in were completely segregated. Some official policies prevented African Americans from enrolling at all or getting anything better than lower-paying menial jobs. These menial jobs did not help people develop better skills or meaningfully increase their spending power, defeating the whole point of the CCC. This was of course, if African Americans could even get into the CCC. Many states had long waiting lists of eligible African American workers, but localities refused to let the CCC build camps to house them, so they could never get in. Robert Fechner, the national director for the CCC, implemented a policy \"never to force colored companies on localities that have openly declared their opposition to them.\"\nThere was often rejection of African Americans on a state level. Florida and Texas came out and stated that they would not allow African Americans in their CCC programs, with Texan officials saying, \"this work is for whites only.\" Eventually, the military had to step in and provide segregated camps for all the African Americans looking for work with the CCC. However, only whites were allowed to lead these units and African Americans were restricted from leadership positions. African Americans were rarely promoted to higher-paying jobs, like machine operators or clerks even for those who had experience in that work as a civilian. African Americans faced harsh racism from other white corps members, often being called racial slurs, forced to the back of lines, and receiving the worst equipment. Even if they could get into a New Deal program designed to create jobs and encourage skill development, African Americans were systemically restricted from reaping the benefits their white counterparts could. \nAfrican Americans were deprived of other New Deal employment benefits and programs. In 1933 the National Recovery Administration was formed to create fair regulations on industries by implementing minimum wages, maximum hours, and product prices. Much like the CCC, this was an important and good idea; it meant that when people could finally find work in the failing economy, it would pay a living wage and have fair working hours. However, this was once again only the case for white workers. The regulations made by the NRA excluded agriculture and domestic service, both of which were predominantly African American. The NRA even went as far as to exclude sub-industries that were predominantly African American by excluding cotton ginning, canning, and citrus packing, from the new worker protection regulations. \nWhen African Americans were in industries to which the NRA regulations applied, distinctions were made to reduce their minimum wage. Industries were considered either north or south, and due to differences in living costs of the two areas the south had a lower minimum wage. This was weaponized. In Delaware, fertilizer manufacturing was 90% African American and was considered a southern industry, giving those workers a lower wage. In contrast, the rest of Delaware's predominantly white industry was considered northern and granted a higher minimum wage. The effects of this are seen in one of the first codes created by the NRA: it increased the minimum wage of the cotton textile industry but bypassed African Americans by excluding cleaners, outside crew, and yardmen. Of the fourteen thousand African Americans in the cotton textile industry, ten thousand held one of those jobs. The NRA achieved its goal by increasing prices throughout the production chain, including the final product, the clothing. However, as the NAACP complained, \"For these workers the NRA meant increases of from 10 to 40 percent in the cost of everything they had to buy, without a single penny in increased wages.\" While an excellent achievement for supporting the white working class against unfair working conditions, the NRA failed to help and in fact actively hurt African Americans.\nNew Deal housing programs also discriminated against African Americans. Roosevelt understood that creating affordable housing was vital for his New Deal, so the Public Works Administration (PWA) was founded in 1933 to achieve this. The PWA planned to build affordable housing while also creating jobs in construction. When the PWA was created, Harold Ickes, one of the few racially liberal members in the administration and an NAACP member, was put in charge. Although most officials wanted the housing to go to the white middle and working-class families, Ickes was able to get one-third of the units to be designated for African Americans; this was an unprecedented amount of housing support for African Americans. However, he could not get the housing integrated despite this significant success. \nOf the forty-seven housing projects this New Deal program made, seventeen went to African Americans, six were segregated, and the remaining 24 were completely white. Ickes implemented the neighborhood composite rule, which required that housing projects had to reflect their neighborhood's racial composition, in an attempt to reduce housing segregation. This rule was often not followed and, in fact, was used to create the opposite effect. City planners would put segregated PWA housing for African Americans in areas they had already designated as exclusively African American. This meant that when poor African Americans needed affordable housing, they could only find it in areas that had been pre-segregated by city planners, furthering segregation in already segregated cities. A civic leader in Miami told federal administrators that \"sites were chosen to remove the entire coloured population\". \nIn many cases before the New Deal, areas had become integrated due to working-class African Americans and white people needing to live close to the factories they worked in. The PWA, however, segregated these areas by putting all-white housing in integrated areas; they wanted to be all white, and the opposite was done for African Americans. In this way the PWA was actively segregating areas that had previously managed to break through racial divides. \nThese PWA projects also had other unjust consequences. For example, the first PWA project in Techwood, Atlanta was built by destroying the Flats, a low-income integrated neighborhood with 1600 families, a third of which were African American. Six hundred and four units replaced it for whites only, segregating a previously integrated community and displacing many African American families. These evicted families had to find new places to live, which often meant crowding into neighborhoods that were already segregated. In theory, they could go to the new public housing made for African Americans, but they did not qualify because those were made for the middle class. Many people had to crowd in with their families in areas with high population density. This contributed to the creation of African American neighborhood slums.\nIn 1937 the PWA was shut down, and in its place, the United States Housing Authority (USHA) was founded. Instead of the PWA on the federal level creating the housing projects, it was now up to states to create their own public housing, and USHA would provide subsidies to pay for them. Icke's rule of preserving the racial composition of neighborhoods remained, but it was ignored once again. The USHA manual stated that creating projects in predominantly African American areas was undesirable. In Texas, the first USHA projects were made by Lyndon Johnson, who put the African American projects in east Austin's black neighborhood and the white projects on the west side. The projects were used to solidify and make the segregation that was already there even more rigid. This was especially harmful considering that before the New Deal cities were slowly becoming more integrated, but through the government's use of USHA and segregated projects, progress was set back. \nGovernment-created projects were not the only option for people struggling during the Great Depression to find housing. In theory, people could get loans to buy their own houses; however, homeownership was very expensive and often out of reach for middle-class families. Banks required large 50% down payments, interest-only payments, and loans had to be fully paid in five to seven years. Because few could afford to buy houses due to these lending practices, the construction industry was crippled. \nRoosevelt realized something had to change, and he created the Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC). HOLC would buy mortgages that were about to be foreclosed on and create new mortgages with longer repayment periods. This allowed families to keep their homes while still paying off their loans. HOLC's loans were relatively low interest, but they still required regular payments, and so they would only give loans to people and areas they thought they could trust. The process of deciding was based on local real estate agents appraising the home and surrounding homes. However, real estate agents had to uphold segregation due to article 34 of the Realtor Code of Ethics, which forbade realtors from introducing other races into white neighborhoods. This meant that every piece of advice HOLC received was already tainted by racism. \nEventually, maps would be made outlining what areas were safe for loans; green areas meant safe, and red meant risky. If an area was predominantly African American, it would automatically be marked red even if it was largely middle class. This established geographic lines of segregation in the housing market, which prevented asset building for African American communities, since a home was a family's largest asset. For example, in St. Louis, Ladue was colored green because, according to an appraiser, it had \"not a single foreigner or negro.\" Conversely Lincoln Terrace, a similarly middle-class suburb, was colored red and was considered to have \"little or no value today... due to the colored element now controlling the district.\" Although people buying in red areas could still get loans, they were much less likely to qualify, and these redlined neighborhoods still were massively disadvantaged. The effects of this redlining are still seen today in housing values and demographic patterns. This also was an instance of the government blatantly saying that African Americans were risky due to their race alone. \nIn 1934 Roosevelt implemented the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), which had similar goals to HOLC, but instead, it insured loans and did its own appraisals. FHA insured bank mortgages that covered eighty percent of the purchased price, had twenty-year terms and were fully amortized. Banks now had the ability to make riskier loans because those loans were now insured by the FHA. Appraisers were given an FHA guidebook that outlined how to rate an area and determine if someone there could qualify for FHA loan insurance. The guidebook enforced rigid segregation. During the appraisals, the FHA only insured loans to white people and even considered white neighborhoods close to African Americans neighborhoods risky due to possible future integration. The guidebook stated, \"If a neighborhood is to retain stability, it is necessary that properties shall continue to be occupied by the same social and racial classes. A change in social or racial occupancy generally contributes to instability and a decline in values.\" The FHA also actively discouraged banks from giving loans to anyone in an urban neighborhood, which were predominantly African American; instead, they wanted those loans going to newly built suburbs. \nLoans were also more likely to go to buyers in white areas that had highways or boulevards separating those neighborhoods from the African Americans ones, with the guidebook saying:\n[n]atural or artificially established barriers will prove effective in protecting a neighborhood and the locations within it from adverse influences, . . . includ[ing] prevention of the infiltration of . . . lower class occupancy, and inharmonious racial groups. \n\nThis served only to create more segregation as it encouraged barriers between white and black communities. For example, one private builder wanted to construct a housing development near a primarily African American neighborhood in Detroit. However, he could not get the FHA to insure the loans for the homes he planned on building because there was no barrier separating the African American neighborhood. In response, he built a half-mile, six-foot-tall concrete wall between his desired building area and the neighborhood. Once he finished the wall, and the FHA was assured it would prevent integration, they agreed to insure the home loans. \nAlong with housing, the FHA had an interest in keeping schools segregated. If schools became more integrated, it would encourage African Americans to move into those areas because, according to the FHA:\n...if the children of people living in such an area are compelled to attend school where the majority or a considerable number of the pupils represent a far lower level of society or an incompatible racial element, the neighborhood under consideration will prove far less stable and desirable than if this condition did not exist\u2026\n\nThe FHA would also often prohibit banks from giving loans to African Americans. In New Jersey, a development was being made in the suburban part of Fanwood. A real estate agent tried to sell 12 properties to middle-class African Americans who had good credit and banks willing to make loans as long as the FHA approved. FHA said they did not approve of those loans and that \"no loans will be given to colored developments.\" Today Fanwood has only a five percent black population in a country that is twenty-five percent African American.\nIt is hard to say how effective Roosevelt's New Deal was in bringing America out of the Great Depression because, in 1939, World War II broke out. The war stimulated the economy in many ways. It revived existing industries like textiles and steel and brought new industries like petroleum, chemicals, aviation, and electronics. The new hyperactive war industry created many jobs and was a huge economic stimulus to almost every American industry. This effectively ended the Great Depression. Although the war revived the economy, it did not change the effects of the discriminatory New Deal programs that were still hurting African Americans. Many of Roosevelt's racially unjust programs lasted past his presidency and continued to harm. \nThese negative effects on African Americans in the Great Depression are so significant to identify because they did not happen in a vacuum. The segregation and oppression caused by all of these New Deal programs persist. Fanwood, New Jersey, is just one example of how the effects of segregation are still seen even almost ninety years later. Even if many of the mentioned New Deal programs have either disappeared or been changed they still have a lasting effect. The systematic exclusion of African Americans from employment and housing programs left them behind as the white middle class was allowed to build wealth, while African Americans could not.\n\nAnnotated Bibliography\nAllison, Robert J.

Due to the victory over Persia, Athens was in a golden age. The polis became a center for the arts and education. This meant Socrates grew up in the ideal time for philosophical thought. He was in a place where individual thought was valued, as Athens was a democracy, and the ability to convince others of your ideas was even more valuable. Although Athens was doing very well, because it was a democracy there were always tensions between it and Sparta. Then due to various smaller conflicts between the two, the threat of a Spartan attack and an oligarchical takeover of Athens was on every Athenian's mind. So, when the Peloponnesian war began between Athens and Sparta this threat was only increased. This meant during the middle of Socrate\u2019s life tensions in Athens were high, and at 70 years old he was put on trial for corrupting the youth and opposing the Athenian religion. But were these the real reasons? Why was Socrates put on trial? Socrates was put on trial because of his outspokenness about his disdain for some Athenian ideals, the actions of his followers and apprentices, and the recent political changes in Athens.\n\n\tIn this paper I will first cover some of Socrates controversial beliefs and how outspoken he was about them. Secondly, I will talk about the actions of his followers and students and how those affected his reputation. Lastly, I will discuss the three events that happened in Athens that deeply changed the political nature of the polis, and were the final straws that caused Socrates' trial. In this paper I used I.F. Stone\u2019s book The Trial of Socrates, and Plato\u2019s dialogue Apology as my primary sources. I chose the trial of Socrates as my topic because I\u2019ve always been interested in philosophy, and recently discovered an interest in Athens and ancient Greece. This made this topic seem like the perfect fit. I would like to thank Ms. Lorencz, a speech and communication instructor at Dakota County Technical College.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\nSocrates was raised in a period of Athens where education and intellectual pursuits were highly valued. After studying philosophy with multiple different teachers he eventually became a sophist. Soon he would be debating any elder or anyone of any significance he could find. During this time he would develop his own style of debate that would become known as the Socratic method. He did this for many years and gained many young followers, but also gained a lot of contempt among the older Athenians for his differing opinions on many Athenian ideals. Eventually at age 71 he was put on trial for corrupting the youth and denying the Athenian gods. He was convicted and sentenced to death. But, why was he really put on trial, what happened during his life that led to the trial? Socrates was put on trial because of how his outspokenness about his disdain for some Athenian ideals influenced the actions of his followers and students, who in turn caused societal and political chaos in Athens.\nSocrates grew up in a time where philosophy was mainly focused on religion and ideas about the universe. But, Socrates was more interested in \u201cvalue theory and ethics''. He believed that the Athenian religious education system taught people that they shouldn't try to be good because in some way every action would offend the god of something. For example, from the beginning of one of Euripides\u2019 plays \u201cthe goddess Aphrodite vows to destroy Hippolytus because he slights her, the goddess of lust. If \nmortals are too chaste, they will offend the goddess of lust; if mortals are too sober, they will offend the god of wine and strong drink; if they are too just, they will dishonor the god of deceit.\u201d This was almost opposite of what Socrates believed. He thought that \n2\nvirtue and moral goodness were the most important qualities to pursue and obtain throughout your life. Socrates spent his life pursuing these ideals while also trying to get others to join him in this pursuit. It was so important to him that he be virtuous and moral that he would constantly engage himself and others in dialogues in order to discover the best principles. This is how he developed the Socratic method. He would ask a series of questions, usually starting with simple questions, that got progressively more difficult to answer. He would eventually lead the person to admitting a flaw in their belief. One example of his method is in Plato\u2019s Apology when Socrates defends himself, he talks to Meletus, one of his accusers, about the nature of his religious beliefs.\nThen, by the gods, Meletus, of whom we are speaking, tell me and the court, in somewhat plainer terms, what you mean! for I do not as yet understand whether you affirm that I teach others to acknowledge some gods, and therefore do believe in gods and am not an entire atheist - this you do not lay to my charge; but only that they are not the same gods which the city recognizes - the charge is that they are different gods. Or, do you mean to say that I am an atheist simply, and a teacher of atheism?\n\nThis method was useful for not just winning debates, but also discovering new ideas and beliefs. Although always debating others can be a great intellectual pursuit, it can often make you enemies with many people, especially when touching on topics considered sacred.\nAthens and the rest of the ancient world held strong beliefs in gods and religion. Socrates would often argue that the uncritical acceptance of gods, religions, and myths lead to absurd conclusions about our world and how we should act. Socrates believed that a person should hold as many true beliefs and as few false ones as possible, so when he saw people simply accept the Athenian gods and religions as a true belief, he \n3\nfelt compelled to help them clear the false beliefs and discover true ones. However Socrates himself wasn't irreligious. Multiple times he claimed to have a divine inner voice that would talk to him during important decisions or times when he was making wrong choices. When it came to the way people worshipped and what they believed about the gods, most thought the gods wanted people to revere and worship them. Socrates thought that if these gods deserve our worship they are moral beings and would want their people to act justly and with moral goodness. Therefore, the best way to worship them was to pursue moral goodness and virtue. Although he held disdain for the beliefs of many religious people,  Socrates still had respect for the religious traditions of Athens. \nDemocracy was a defining characteristic of Athens and an idea and institution that was very important and loved by Athenians. But, Socrates had some problems with it. As someone who placed extreme value in critical analysis of beliefs, he thought that the average citizen would not be educated enough in rational thought to effectively vote for the best candidate. Socrates has a discussion with Adeimantus in Plato\u2019s Book Six of The Republic, where he makes an analogy with a ship heading out to sea. He asks Adeimantus if he would rather have random people pick a captain for his voyage or people with experience and knowledge of ships and the sea. Adeimantus answers the latter, to which Socrates responds, then why should any average person be fit to decide who leads Athens? Despite this belief he didn't argue for voting restrictions, instead he \n4\nbelieved in a philosopher king, a ruler who pursues and possesses wisdom, virtue, knowledge, a simple life, and philosophical thought. It was often pointed out that these people wouldn\u2019t want to rule, to which Socrates would say that people who don't want political power are the ones who can be trusted with it. He never tried to act on these ideas directly, but he did try to spread them to as many people as possible.\n\tThe people who followed Socrates were usually very passionate about their ideas, and were willing to take actions he didn\u2019t necessarily support. Those actions reflected negatively on Socrates. Because Socrates was always willing to debate even the most respected and revered people, he developed a following of mostly young men. They enjoyed seeing their elders being outsmarted, and so naturally they were attracted to Socrates. As a side effect of these debates the young men would come to accept and support many of Socrates' ideas and act upon them.  This is most apparent during the Peloponnesian war when Athens surrendered to Sparta and the Rule of 30 was installed, an oligarchical group of 30 men who ruled Athens. In order to protect the 30, Sparta gave them guards, many of whom were young men armed with whips who would keep the citizens in order. These guards were seen as the youth that Socrates corrupted, as his ideas were typically anti-democratic. Although his views were not specifically pro oligarchy, it is still hard to deny that his influence created young men who were distrustful of democracy and wanted some kind of change. \nSocrates didn\u2019t just have followers, he also directly taught and influenced many more significant people whose actions would even more so reflect on Socrates. Critias \n5\nwas a student and associate of Socrates and a cousin of Plato, Socrates's most famous student. Socrates and Critias are seen in many of Plato\u2019s dialogues, however in most of them Critias is more of a peacemaking force during the debates. After Athens surrendered to Sparta and the Rule of 30 was installed, Critias was made one of the leaders. What followed was the death of the democracy and many Athenian citizens, as the oligarchy was not merciful in its ways of controlling its citizens. During this time Socrates still talked to Critias, but he was usually criticising him, Socrates says to Critias \u201cif someone was a herdsman and made his cattle fewer and more poor, would he not agree that he was a bad herdsman; yet it is a great wonder, if someone was a leader of a city and made his citizens fewer and poorer, that he would not be ashamed nor think himself a bad leader of a city\u201d. The fact that Socrates taught someone who would go on to commit the most blatant attack on the Athenian democracy certainly didn\u2019t make him popular among Athenians.\nAnother one of Socrates' students was Alcibiades. He and Socrates became incredibly close after fighting in multiple military campaigns together, and each saving the other's life. However, Alcibiades was very extravagant and self-centered. This conflicted with Socrates' beliefs, but he still saw intellectual promise in Alcibiades. Socrates wanted to try to help Alcibiades become a better person, but he eventually betrayed Socrates. Alcibiades chose a life of politics that Socrates disapproved of, and went back to his indulgent ways. He would go on to be an accomplished member of the military and convinced Athens to start a military campaign in Syracuse. However, upon \n6\narriving there he was sent back to Athens to face trial for a crime. On his way back he escaped to Sparta, where he told the Spartans to send support to Syracuse and other Athenian plans. This caused the expedition to completely fail and all of the fleet to be captured and destroyed, this was a massive blow to Athens because their navy was the only thing keeping them in the fight against Sparta. The Delian league was a group of poleis formed by Athens after the persian war to continue a defense against them, but eventually it evolved into something close to an Athenian empire. Their support was crucial to Athens during the peloponnesian war, and Alcibiades and the scicillian expedition caused them to stop supporting Athens. Once again we have a student of Socrates going on to cause incredible harm to Athens and it\u2019s democracy.\n\tSocrates was 70 when he was put on trial, but he had been allegedly corrupting the youth and arguing against the gods for all his life, so what changed? There were two major changes in Athens that affected the political climate and caused popular opinion on Socrates to change. The first event happened after the Sicilian disaster and the Delian league withdrawing its support from Athens. General Peisander, an Athenian general, took advantage of how weak Athens was. He went to many of Athens' small subject cities and changed policy there making the democracies into oligarchies. This created support for an oligarchical takeover of Athens. When General Peisander and his fellow conspirators made it to Athens, the secret clubs made it easier for him to start working. They killed the most prominent member of the democratic party then, and \n7\nwould kill anyone who spoke against them. The fear these actions caused made the threat seem larger than it was. An oligarchy called the 400 would eventually emerge, but would only rule for a few months. Although it was short lived, the fact that democracy was overthrown and the threat seemed so large many Athenian were rightfully more on edge.\nThe second event was another oligarchy. In 404 BCE after Athens surrendered to Sparta, the Rule of 30, led by Critias, overthrew the Athenian democracy. Although Socrates was against this tyrannical oligarchy, he was so openly against democracy that it was difficult to separate himself from this oligarchy. His own student led the overthrow and other followers were the guards for the Rule of 30. Both of these oligarchies were tyrannical and restrictive on freedoms. These two events affected Athens so much because it was a polis built on free speech and democracy. In a place like Athens where countless artists of all varieties came to express themselves and their opinions, free speech was crucial. When these values were undermined twice by two different oligarchies, Athenians had every right to be fearful of another oligarchy and the people perceived to cause them. The clearest target was Socrates, the man who taught and influenced all of these conspirators.\n\tSocrates\u2019s openness and confrontational method of debate attracted a large and passionate following that often acted in ways Socrates\u2019 himself wouldn\u2019t have. It is likely that Socrates might not have been put on trial for just his controversial beliefs that challenged the status quo and the actions of his passionate followers. He wasn\u2019t \n8\ncharged with crimes until he was 70 years old.  Political chaos in Athens changed how Athenians viewed people like Socrates. Why was Socrates put on trial? He was put on trial for the acts committed under the influence of his philosophy. Socrates whether he meant to or not influenced many young men, through his unique style of debate and outspokenness. These men would go on to cause political chaos in Athens which would fundamentally change Athenian politics and society, in a way that would make what seemed to be well meaning debate on Socrates part seem more like attempts to disrupt Athenian democracy. Many philosophers are remembered for their specific philosophies, but few are remembered as the point where philosophy took a turn. He was so influential that every philosopher before him is called a pre-socratic. Socrates brought philosophy away from speculation about the universe, and down to earth to figure out the nature of morality and ethics. This is his biggest contribution to philosophy and the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnotated Bibliography\nBuller, Jeffrey L. \"Peloponnesian War.\" Edited by Mark W. Chavalas.

I really enjoy playing lacrosse, coding, football, and music, but I wouldn't really call those passions in the way that Frankenstein had a passion for reanimation. I guess a better way to put it is I enjoy doing these things but I don't really have any ambition to pursue them. I would be content doing them for the rest of life as side hobbies, but couldn\u2019t see myself dedicating my life to any of them.\n\n\nOct 20: What do parents owe their children?\n\n\tI think on a very basic level parents owe their children food, water, shelter, and love/care. These are the things that are required for the kid to grow up healthy and at least somewhat happy. On a deeper level though things like friendship, being or at least pretending to be interested in the things the kid enjoys, and things that are less important to their health, but are important to their mental wellbeing. What I think is more interesting is what do the kids owe back to their parents. I think the parents entered into the relationship, they brought you into this world so you don't owe them anything, at least at first. When the parent has given the bare minimum, the kid doesn't really owe them anything. But, when the parents have made the effort to extend the relationship to being more than just parents but to friends you owe them more.\n\n\nNov 29: What dialect do you speak? How much do you code switch?\n\n\tI think my dialect is probably the same as the average teenage boy, I use slang, I use pretty simple words most of the time, and I talk in simple sentences usually. I\u2019m not sure if I really have an accent.\n\tWhen it comes to code switching I think the time I do it the most is just when talking to adults vs kids. When I get home I will use less slang that I think my parents won't understand, but for the most part I talk the same. For adults that I\u2019m less close with I will usually talk with very little slang and try to sound a little smarter. There are also times when I\u2019m talking to certain friends, when I will talk even more like a teenager. I also notice that I don't really switch my clothing when it comes to going somewhere fancy/nice.\n\n\nJan 25: What did you think of Adichie's TED talk?\nHow does it show up in USA\nHow does it up in your life\nDiscuss a single story of yours, are there other stories that don't get told\n\tI thought Adichie's TED talk was really interesting because it pointed out something that seems obvious but you don't really notice when it happens. For example when shes talking about her roomate assumed she didn't know how to use a stove seems obviously stupid and offensive. However, if you've gone your whole  life being told the single story that people in Africa are all very poor, don't have electricity, and have completely different music of course you are going to assume those things when meeting someone from there. I think things like these are very prominent in the USA because so much of our understanding of the world is from \n\n\nFeb 22: What are the goals in terms of raising a child? What does a child need to attain these goals\n\n\tI think on a basic level the goals of raising a child are keeping them alive, healthy, and happy. On a deeper level they should be raised to have critical thinking skills, be able to socialize, have some level of emotional intelligence, not have any trauma, and the skills to be whatever the kid wants to be as an adult. I think for a child to attain these goals they need to have supportive guardians who allow them freedom while still protecting their safety. A kid should be able to express their feelings to their guardians and try new things and meet new people without fear of punishments. I think the goal for a child should never be specific for a guardian."}]}

I\u2019ve grown up in an era of democratized information; anything I could want to know is accessible. I know every little detail about NFL teams\u2019 rosters that I don\u2019t even care about because apps on my phone send me notifications about them. Protests, bombings, and shootings across the world are injected straight into my consciousness through Instagram, TikTok, and my news app. Not having this constant stream of updates, changes, and news constantly vibrating in my pocket seems impossible; it has always been my normal. Although this flow of information can feel overwhelming, it has been defining for me. At a point in my life when I felt unsure of who I was or what I cared about, the internet and all its information gave me the chance to discover a passion that has shaped my identity. \n\tIn eighth grade, just a couple of months before Covid-19 hit, my English teacher had us do what seemed like a silly exercise that somehow related to whatever book we were reading. She gave us all a piece of paper and told us to draw ourselves and then, in some way, draw the different pieces of our identities on or around ourselves. I quickly sketched myself and then sat there; I had no idea what to draw. I scanned the classroom and saw everyone else effortlessly adding to their pictures while I felt lost. I eventually drew a football, a video game controller, and some music notes, but none felt like identities; they were just something to draw. At the time, it felt like everyone around me knew who they were, what they loved, and what they wanted to do with their lives. I know now that many, if not all, of my classmates were feeling the same way. They were also just drawing to look busy; however, at the time, 14 year old Max felt alone and lost in this identity crisis, which was probably dramatic for someone my age, but the feeling was intense. I sat with this feeling for a while, letting myself get swept up in the distractions of everyday life.\nHowever, I could only avoid my mini-crisis for so long when, a few weeks later, we went into lockdown, and suddenly, I was stuck at home without school or friends to distract me, and I had to find something to keep me occupied. I had always been interested in computers and technology; when I was younger, I would take old, broken printers and RC cars into our basement and take them apart. I wanted to know what was happening inside and what made them tick. Of course, seeing the inside didn\u2019t explain anything to me; if anything, I was only more confused but also more curious. Eventually, my curiosity shifted from hardware to software as I played online games and began using the internet. I no longer wanted to know how the physical machines worked but rather how somebody wrote some words and got a game to appear on my phone. Despite my interest, I had always been intimidated by learning to code; there seemed like so many steps just to get started that I had never tried. But, after a few weeks of doing nothing during the lockdown, a mixture of boredom, lots of time, and years of pent-up interest, I decided to google the easiest coding languages to learn. The answer online seemed to be unanimous: Python. So, I promptly got on YouTube, searched for a Python tutorial, and received hundreds of results. I clicked the most viewed one and got started. \nThe video was great, and Python seemed to click for me. I quickly fell down the rabbit hole; I watched tutorial after tutorial, learning more and more until I felt confident enough to try doing a project without a video guide. I decided to make a text-based blackjack game. I struggled, but luckily, with every hurdle I encountered, I could either overcome them myself or find resources online to help me. Finishing that first little game, getting it to work exactly as I had imagined it in my head, filled me with a sense of satisfaction and pride I had never gotten before. I knew then that I had at least found a piece of my identity, an interest I felt connected to. Through coding, I also learned more about myself, like how meaningful it is to translate an idea in my head into something tangible and that I need to try things no matter how intimidating they seem. \nLooking back on this discovery of my love of coding, one detail stands out: how easy it was to dive in. I can\u2019t help but imagine if I had that same burst of motivation to learn just 20 years earlier, I would have had to find a book on coding or someone willing to teach me; there would have been some significant time and monetary commitment. It all seems more intimidating than just turning on my laptop and following some free videos. Without YouTube, I may have remained put off by trying to learn something completely new by myself, but the readily available access to just about all of human knowledge allowed me to pursue and discover a passion. Additionally, over the years, I\u2019ve grown my understanding through YouTube tutorials on new languages, machine learning, and philosophical lectures about technology.\nThe immense access we possess is a gift but also a burden. I feel forever grateful to it for allowing me to find a true passion. Still,  I can\u2019t help but notice how there seem to be ten harmful pieces of misinformation for every valuable piece of information. Understanding this is vital to responsibility in using the internet as a society because pure unregulated access to all kinds of information isn\u2019t wholly good, especially when much of it is deceivingly false."}]}

The second to last stanza begins with \"so, friends of my childhood years,\"(42) effectively concluding the rest of the poem before, and switching from talking about her past to the present. She starts these last two stanzas with what sounds like the beginning of a message. Senior talks to all the other girls who went through what she did. Then the following two lines, \"one day we'll talk about/ how the mirror broke.\"(43-44) By saying \"one day,\" she implies that the friends of her childhood years may not be ready for this conversation she wants to have. It is also a vague statement that suggests this conversation will happen at some undetermined time. The mirror represents how she saw herself. She had an image of herself that she borrowed from the ideals presented by her colonial school. She needed to will her skin pale, but now that reflection of herself is broken, and she can see herself for who she is. \nThe following line is \"who kissed us awake\"(45) this is referring to the idea of waking up and realizing the truth, it also alludes to fairy tales like Sleeping Beauty and Snow White. In both those stories the protagonist is put under a sleeping spell and can only be awoken by the kiss of their true love. Olive uses this reference to express how deeply colonial history and ideas were ingrained in the narrator that it took tremendous effort and help to wake up and break free of it. This is the volta of the poem, something switched in the narrator and allowed her to learn how she was affected by colonization. \nThe final line of the first stanza is \"who let Anansi from his bag.\"(46) Anansi is a mythical spider in African folklore known for his intelligence, knowledge, and being a trickster. Anansi is often depicted defeating significantly physically stronger foes by using his knowledge and cunning. In this instance, Anansi's bag is mentioned, which refers to the story of Anansi and the bag of wisdom. That story is about how Anansi tried to bag up all the world's knowledge and hide it from humanity. He didn't think they could be trusted; however, the bag is so full that knowledge keeps falling out, and eventually, he gives up and releases it all. Senior uses Anansi to represent how her whole history and culture were kept from her, but through her intelligence, she could open the bag and gain that knowledge.\nIn the last stanza, the narrator reflects on how her perception has changed. Earlier in the poem, the narrator talks about how she was oppressed and denigrated by pale northern eyes, however in this stanza she says, \u201cNorthern eyes/ in the brighter world before us now/ Pale?\u201d(48-50) The meaning of pale is switched, instead of representing the color of her colonizers, pale now means insignificant and fading. The colonizers that used to be so important in her past are now, in the light of a brighter world, revealing themselves to be faded and unimportant.\nThroughout these last two stanzas there is a certain rhythm that the poem has that is lost. Before the poem, while not having a rhyme scheme, still often rhymes, flows smoothly, and reads somewhat quickly. However, there is no rhyming in these two stanzas and the rhythm significantly slows down. This partially provides emphasis, as it especially slows down in the last stanza. The change in pace also creates the feeling of a close and important conversation. The narrator is trying to talk to someone about her experiences and how she feels about them now."}]}

The poem communicates this through vivid imagery and a general religious/moral tone. It argues that people should be appreciative of the soldiers, but also recognize that this war was God being angry at the colonists for now being good puritans, which implies the Natives were some kind of weapon of the devil.

[Pdf] Retrieved from the Library of Congress, https://www.loc.gov/item/2020776728/. \nThis primary source is printing of a poem written by Wait Winthrop in 1675, but not printed until 1721 in New London, Connecticut. More specifically the printing is a broadside, which was a common form of broadcasting in early American colonies. The author Wait Winthrop was born into a family of governors in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, which means Wait was a puritan. He would go on to lead the Massachusetts army in King Philip's War before becoming a politician. His family, particularly his father and grandfather, were influential in the early New England colonies. King Philip's War, which the poem was written during, was a short but deadly fight between English colonists and multiple native American tribes from 1675-1676. The conflict emerged mostly because of land conflicts between the groups, as the English wanted to keep expanding their colonies into native American land. Wait writes this poem during the war in presumably sophisticated prose, as the reprint specifies the poem has been rewritten in \u201cplain verse\u201d by an unspecified person. This likely means Wait originally wrote the poem for himself and for people similarly educated to him, but upon reprinting someone wanted it to be more accessible to the general public.\nThe poem demonstrates a very particular bend to Waits beliefs about the war and why it's being fought. The first obvious meaning and purpose of the poem is to highlight how brave and incredible he and his soldiers were for fighting in this war. He emphasizes the difficult environmental problems like forests and snow, and also how the natives were stronger foes then he expected. He directly tells the audience on line 17 to \u201c,Open your Eyes, and Sympathize, with those brave Gentlemen, A heart of Flint, it would Releut, to think how it hath been.\u201d Wait wants the English people to know how difficult this war was. However, Wait also makes it clear throughout that the reason the war was difficult was because god was punishing the colonists for their sins. He says on line 22 once again speaking directly to the audience \u201cO New-England , I understand, with thee God is offended: And therefore He doth humble thee, till thou shy ways hast mended.\u201d Wait believes god is trying to humble the people of New England because they haven\u2019t been good enough puritans. It is also not even just that god is humbling the colonists, but also that the native Americans are agents of \u201ctheir god the Devil, \u201d (line 21) which is why they are able to put up such a fight. Wait uses very vivid imagery in the poem and lots of religious language which serves his two main points: the war was very difficult and it was difficult because the New England colonists weren\u2019t good enough puritans. Wait frames the war as an entirely religious matter, a pure test from god, nowhere does he mention economic or territorial motives for the war.\nThis source is particularly interesting and useful because it seems unique as an artistic expression of an important leader's beliefs on a very violent war as it was happening, and that it was only released posthumously as Wait died in 1717 four years before it would be reprinted. The most interesting insight I was able to gather from this source was the cognitive dissonance that seemed to be present in Wait and the audience he is addressing. English colonists approached native Americans from a perspective of being superior in warfare, civilization, religion, and every aspect of life. So, in theory any war against them should be easy, especially since god was on the English side. However, when Wait enters into this war and realizes it isn\u2019t easy he quickly decides it must be god punnishing the colonists because they haven\u2019t been good enough puritans. The only way the native Americans could ever be able to fight back against them would be if they were agents of the devil. This framework also allows Wait to allow the audience to hold both the idea that the English are in every way better and stronger than the native Americans, but also that the soldiers are brave and deserving of sympathy and support for going into war with the agents of the devil for the sins of the colonists. The source deepens my understanding of how colonist, particularly puritan, worldviews were so wrapped up in religion that it allowed them to justify awful beliefs about the native americans and allowed them to overcome cognitive dissonance about the native people being non-advanced barbarians but also often putting up a real fight."}]}

Esch has to learn what being a mother means and looks like by salvaging meaning from her few memories of her mom, made-up stories, and the one mother in her life: her brother's pitbull. Esch has drawn some valuable lessons from these sources, although she still considers herself missing something. By the end, Esch learns that the void might be natural and realizes that no matter her confusion, she will have family and friends there to make it all easier.\n\tEsch works as the perfect device for Ward to investigate motherhood because she is, in many ways, a blank slate. Her mother died before Esch had much time to develop memories of her, and between her family and friends, Esch is surrounded by men. The lack of female role models for Esch to look to and an emotionally distant father force Esch to look outward for the traditional unconditional love and acceptance often found in parents, especially mothers. Esch develops a crush on Manny, her older brother's friend, and the two start a relationship; unfortunately, their relationship quickly becomes abusive due to the age difference. It is clear Esch is being used, but to her, the physical relationship is a sign of love and acceptance. So, when Esch gets impregnated by Manny, she realizes she has to not only grow up without a mother but also learn how to be one herself.\n\tOne of the first places Esch looks to for the meaning of motherhood is her brother's dog, China, who has recently given birth to a litter of puppies. China is also a fighting dog who participates in fights with other pit bulls; this creates a conflict in Esch's understanding. China is the most respected dog in their local fighting ring because she is vicious and aggressive. However, this intensity leads to her killing one of her puppies when it tries to eat her food. Esch sees this happen and has to decide how to interpret it. She respects and admires China for her strength and status; Esch wishes she possessed the same confidence, so she thinks learning from China could be helpful. However, Esch also recognizes the sadness in the puppies' death, and so she must reckon with and balance the inherent suffering that comes with survival and the love and care a mother owes her child. Esch would benefit from being more confident and self-assured, and seeing that in China inspires her. This admiration results in Esch starting to see herself in China, so at the end of the book, when China gets lost in the flood she has a strong response: she imagines the future as she and Skeetah sit by the pit, waiting for China, thinking \"He will look into the future and see her emerge into the circle of his fire\u2026 China. She will return, standing tall and straight\u2026 China will bark and call me sister\u2026 She will know that I am a mother.\" (258) Esch has to imagine China surviving the flood because if China can't then she cannot. If the only mother and strongest female in Esch's life can't survive the worst of life, what does that mean for Esch? She needs this outcome to be a reality. China teaches Esch the passion and intensity of motherhood; to love and raise another, you must first believe in and love yourself, but motherhood is also knowing when to hold back and be soft.\n\tAnother source Esch looks to for guidance in her quest to understand motherhood is Greek mythology, particularly the story of Medea. Medea's story is filled with betrayal and rage, which resonates with Esch, especially after Manny's rejection upon learning of her pregnancy. Medea, who sacrificed everything for her husband, only to be cheated on, responds with an act of vengeance by killing their children and his mistress. This story of extreme love turned into destructive fury is relatable for Esch. She often identifies with Medea's feelings of betrayal and anger, particularly towards Manny and the other men in her life. Esch sees much of herself in Medea: strength, vulnerability, and the complex feelings and emotions surrounding motherhood. Medea's story for Esch, like China's, is not simple; it isn't one of pure love and goodness; it reflects the realities of how difficult and emotional motherhood is, how Esch will have to deal with hardship, but that she has the strength to make it through. \n\tThroughout the book, Esch tries to understand how to be a mother, how she will manage to raise a child when she hardly remembers being raised herself, and how she can love a kid when she struggles to love herself. The realization Esch comes to in the end is that while she does need to learn what being a mother means to her, she is also putting too much pressure on herself. Few parents genuinely know what it means to raise another human before they actually do it; that's why they surround themselves with family and friends who can support them and help them learn. Big Henry teaches this to Esch, telling her, \"This baby got plenty of daddies\" (255). Esch's quest is admirable, salvaging motherhood from different parts of her life, but it is not one she has to go on alone."}]}

The two-hour van ride meant some of us got extra sleep, but I was too focused on staring at the beautiful Utah desert. We finally arrived at the trailhead, quickly unpacked our trailer, and filled our packs with food and water. Lastly, we all applied globs of sunscreen to protect us from the harsh desert sun. \nThe first day of backpacking was longer than expected. The information about how far away the first campsite was about two miles off, so we arrived after an extra two hours of trekking through a canyon river. As painful and brutal as backpacking can be at times, the moment when you reach your campsite and let yourself fall backward onto your pack makes up for it. After a brief respite, we all got back up, set up camp, and began making dinner. We finished eating, and I quickly made my way to our tent, ready to sleep on the soft sand of our site.\nLuckily because we hiked so much extra the first day, our first morning in the backcountry was not too early. Some quick oatmeal got us fueled for another day. The first two miles of the second day were steep, which is a massive morale killer, but a break at the top managed to restore us a little. After doing six miles, we realized we had already gone thirteen of the 15-mile trail. After some deliberation, our leaders decided to find a spot for us to camp. Another short and sweet night was capped off with an incredible sunset we watched from a small cliff. \nThe final morning was only a few miles, but confusion about the correct path added an extra mile. We eventually made it to our van, and we all collapsed into the relatively comfy seats before driving to the gas station to get some junk food."}]}

I've always loved spending time with family, the traditions, and the food. Yet, there seemed to be something deeper that I couldn't quite figure out. During a thought-provoking BioEthics class this year, it all started to make sense. We delved into intense debates about what shapes our identity and the nature of free will. Our discussions revolved around how genetics, external factors, and past experiences shape our personality and decisions. After a week of engaging in sometimes heated debates, we were left with a profound final question on our test: 'Who are you?'\nMy answer, a blend of biological factors and life experiences, brought into focus why Thanksgiving resonates so deeply with me. It's not just a time for hanging out and feasting but a moment of reflection on those who have significantly molded me. If my classroom conclusion holds any truth, no one has shaped my past experiences more than my family and close friends. So, the Thanksgiving table isn't just surrounded by loved ones; it\u2019s a literal representation of nature and nurture.\nThanksgiving at the Petite House exemplifies this realization. It's always a nice blend of familiar scenes and faces, a comforting constant year after year. Our cast is a blend of family - my parents and my siblings, often joined by our grandparents and sometimes by aunts, uncles, and cousins. It's also not unusual for a few family friends to find their way to our Thanksgiving table, each adding interesting elements to our usual family dynamics.\nOur day begins in a somewhat uncommon way, with a neighborhood gathering in Forest Park for ice skating. This tradition, set against a brisk fall morning backdrop, always strikes me as a perfect start. Something about the cold air against our cheeks and the sound of blades cutting across the ice gets you ready for the warmth of a Thanksgiving meal.\nOnce we return, the house transitions into a hub of activity. Time seems to slow as the day is filled with games, laughter, and the slow build-up of aromas from the kitchen. It's a day where the cooking process, the banter over board games, and the constant hum of conversation blend into an atmosphere unique to us.\nAs the day unfolds, I'm captivated by the surreal experience of seeing my family in a different light. Watching my mom laugh and reminisce with her siblings reminds me that she actually existed before I was born. She had a whole life filled with experiences similar to mine. These moments underscore a broader truth that seems obvious but is often overlooked: our parents and relatives have their own rich histories. They, too, once gathered just as we do now, sharing stories and laughter. This realization deepens my sense of connection, reminding me that the heart of the family \u2013 its laughter, stories, and unspoken bonds \u2013 is ever-present and unchanging.\nAll of this, of course, leads up to the most important part: the food. Everyone squeezes into our dining room, sorting ourselves into kid's and adult's tables. We scramble to get our share of the feast before settling back into our seats. This is when one of my favorite conflicts arises: the fight between wanting to eat without stopping and the urge to talk to everyone. The food usually ends up winning the battle for me, but I'm more of a listener anyway. Thanksgiving conversations are always fun, telling old stories we've heard hundreds of times before but still love hearing and catching up on what everyone has been up to. It's a time when everyone talks and listens; it's a time when everyone's in on the jokes, and it's a time when you don't have to worry about how much you're eating because, well, it's Thanksgiving.\nFrom my seat at the kids' table, I can see all those who have shaped me. There's Emma, my sister, who instilled in me an unwavering sense of justice and drive to fight for it. My mom is right there, too, who showed me how to deeply love amidst life's relentless responsibilities. Then there's my dad, who passed on to me both a thirst for knowledge and, just as importantly, an undying passion for the Steelers. Sammi, my other sister, nurtured my love for music and taught me the value of bringing people together. My brother Jack, with his easy-going nature, showed me how to not take things too seriously while still caring about what matters. Kevin, my other brother, instilled a deep love for nature in me and taught me to appreciate the rich narratives in books and movies. It's not just them; my aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents, and friends also surround me, each gifting me little pieces of their identities that I now proudly claim as part of my own.\nSo, if all my mornings in BioEthics have taught me anything, it is to appreciate the intricate tapestry of people and experiences that define me; to appreciate how deeply intertwined we are with those around us. The question 'Who are you?' from our discussions isn't just theoretical; it finds its answer around the Thanksgiving table.\nToday, surrounded by the faces that have shaped me, I am filled with gratitude - for each person who has contributed to my story, my classmates who chose me to speak today, and the invaluable lessons that have brought us all together. In this auditorium, I see not just family and friends but the living narrative of who I am and who we all are, a narrative for which I am profoundly grateful. Thank you and happy Thanksgiving."}]}

With unemployment rates on the rise, many people are considering a universal basic income as a viable option. This paper will first give background information on what a universal basic income is and the ways it has been used in the past. Then it will present the view of the proponents, who believe that a universal basic income would solve income inequality, poverty, and many other social and economic problems. The opponents believe that a universal basic income would do more harm than good by reducing incentive to work and costing more than we can afford. After learning the beliefs of both sides this paper will show the solution to the universal basic income debate. If the United States did not have such a high poverty rate and currently an especially high unemployment rate it would be smart to say dramatic change is not needed. However, that is not the case. Now is the time to implement a universal basic income in a way that not only solves economic problems but also environmental ones.\n\tA universal basic income is an unconditional annual or monthly payment to all people part of a state or country. Some universal basic incomes have age restrictions. Universal basic incomes have been used mostly in trials. However, Alaska has had The Alaska Permanent Fund that began in 1981 and is still going. Alaska takes twenty-five percent of its oil revenue and gives that to the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation which invests that money into global stocks. The money earned from that investment fund is distributed in equal shares to every citizen annually, usually $1000-$2000.  \n           An example of a trial universal basic income is in northern Uganda. It was funded by the Youth Opportunities Program. It gave small groups of young people $328 to spend on learning or improving skills in order to help them end their poverty. In the first four years it helped a lot, as the families who received it rose out of poverty, but five years later at the end of the trial the control group had caught up to the recipients. This proved that universal basic income only sped up the escape from poverty, which is a great result but not the ideal one. The best result would have been the recipients having a higher sustainable income as compared to those who did not receive the basic income boost. \nAnother universal basic income trial is an ongoing one in Kenya. This trial will be tested in two large counties in Kenya: the first is Siaya with a population of 940 thousand and the second is Bomet with a population of 860 thousand. There are 630 thousand people below Kenya\u2019s poverty line (US$15 per household member monthly). This trial has 4 groups.  The first is a control group of 100 villages who will receive no extra money. The second is the long-term trial where 44 villages will receive US$0.75 per day, enough to cover basic needs, for 12 years. The third group is a short-term trial where 80 villages will get US$0.75 every day for 2 years. The last group is the lump sum trial where 71 villages will receive a one-time payment of US$500, which is equal to the total the short-term trial will get.  Because this trial began in 2018, the first set of results will not be released for another few months, so it is hard to say how it will change things.  Still, it is the largest trial yet and will provide a lot of valuable information for assessing the effectiveness of universal basic income. Even though GiveDirect, the NGO behind this trial, has not released any of their findings, the Kenyan government has reported an increase in happiness and life satisfaction, and a decrease in stress and depression. \nThe success of the Alaska Permanent Fund, benefits for workers, creating a system that is better than welfare, and the potential to end poverty are all reasons a universal basic income has gained significant traction in the last few years. Since its creation in 1981, the Alaska permanent fund has proved to be very beneficial. Using the Gini coefficient, a way of measuring income inequality, each state was ranked, with 1st being the best and 50th being the worst.  At the creation of the fund, Alaska was ranked 30th, but by 2015, 34 years later, it had risen to 2nd, largely due to its universal basic income program. Because universal basic income increased each citizen\u2019s purchasing power, the Alaskan economy grew and 10,000 new jobs were created. A research paper published in 2019 by Damon Jones, a professor at the University of Chicago\u2019s Harris School of Public Policy, and Ioana Elena Marinescu, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s School of Social Policy and Practice, looks at how unemployment rates in Alaska have changed since 1981.  Their study shows that since the creation of this program, it has not caused a decrease in employment and instead caused a slight increase. The Alaska Permenant Fund also has decreased the probability for a 3-year-old to be obese by 4.5%, and it has reduced the total number of 3-year-old obesity cases by 22.4%. This is because for many poor people the cheapest option for food is fast food and most healthy food is more expensive, but with the universal basic income they can afford healthier food without worrying about not being able to pay for other things. \nThe core of any economy is people working and earning money. 44% of 18-64 year olds are employed in low wage jobs, but if these workers had the ability to find higher-paying jobs it would improve not only their livelihoods but also the economy. A universal basic income would provide low wage workers a safety net to give them the freedom to explore other careers, go back to school, or get better at a skill to get a higher-paying job where they already work. A universal basic income would also give workers some bargaining power in the job market, so they do not have to settle for a job that does not pay enough. If workers find themselves between jobs, they do not have to worry about not being able to provide for themselves or their families, making it easier for them to spend additional time to find a new well-paying job.\nUniversal basic income also improves quality of life.  Many people have families at home.  People would get to spend more time with their children if they earned a higher wage that allowed them to work fewer hours. Or, working fewer hours might give them more time to care for an elderly parent or a loved one in need. \nUniversal basic income creates a safety net. The United States has had its fair share of crises. With the nature of the economy, or because of natural disasters, stock market crashes, disease, or war, recessions happen and people lose their jobs. A universal basic income would act as a buffer, if everyone was able to keep having an income during a crisis.  If people who have lost their jobs still had a basic income, their spending power could keep stimulating the economy and could help avoid another recession. \nA universal basic income also comes with many smaller benefits that can still help a lot. Welfare programs are an alternative to universal basic income.  One problem with welfare programs, however, is that they only start helping people when they hit rock bottom; a universal basic income would help prevent people from even getting to that point.\nScot Santens, founder of the Economic Security Project, said, \u201c A UBI set at $1,000 per adult per month and $300 per child per month would eradicate US poverty entirely.\u201d Of course giving out that amount of money may not be possible without cutting programs or raising taxes, but the fact that it could do this means that any amount of basic income could result in real progress toward ending poverty.\nSome people believe a universal basic income is not worth the cost and reduced working hours it would create. What opponents of a universal basic income usually mention first is the cost of it. It is difficult to say a definite cost because there are so many different approaches. However, looking at Andrew Yang\u2019s universal basic income program allows us to work with a number. Yang, a politician who built his campaign around a universal basic income, proposed giving $1000 monthly or $12,000 yearly to everyone over 18.  If one multiplies $12,000 by 209,128,094, the number of people 18 and up, the total cost annually would be $2,509,537,130,000 or about $2.5 trillion. The total cost of welfare annually is roughly $1.03 trillion. That leaves a $1.47 trillion deficit to fund universal basic income if all welfare was removed. If welfare was kept, universal basic income would cost an additional $2.5 trillion, for a total of 3.53 trillion in welfare a UBI expenditures. Considering how much debt the U.S. already has, it could be very dangerous to implement a universal basic income. To free up that much money would require major tax increases and cutting programs. The reason welfare is so much cheaper is because there is a separation of who needs help and who is fine, so getting rid of that separation is what causes the increase in cost.\nOpponents of universal basic income also argue that it would hurt the poor more than help them. Since everyone would pay a tax to fund it, and everyone regardless of income level would receive it, a universal basic income program would take money from the poor and distribute it to the wealthy. It also would be giving money to people able to work, while elderly people or people with disabilities who need it the most would be taxed to support the program. \nOpponents also argue that welfare not only costs less, but also more directly helps. Welfare provides people with more than just money, it gives them help with addiction, health, and lack of skills. Unlike universal basic income, welfare has conditions, since many of the programs require people to be looking for a job to qualify for payments. Welfare also includes things like medicare, disability insurance, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, Social Security, unemployment insurance, and Section 8 housing vouchers. $12,000 every year would not cover those benefits.\nReduced labor or working hours is another major con of a universal basic income. \"If we pay people, unconditionally, to do nothing... they will do nothing,\" says Charles Wyplosz, PhD, Professor of International Economics at the Graduate Institute in Geneva. Economist Allison Schrager, PhD, says most people work hard because there is a level of uncertainty for the future. By ensuring people's monthly payments, they lose that uncertainty and feel more comfortable not doing anything. Elizabeth Anderson, PhD, Professor of Philosophy and Women's Studies at the University of Michigan, says that a universal basic income would cause people \"to abjure work for a life of idle fun... and depress the willingness to produce and pay taxes of those who resent having to support them.\"\nIt is easy to claim that a universal basic income would cost too much, because it is generally presumed that it would be funded by cutting programs or raising taxes on everyone. However, using the plans this paper is about to present the American people could be reaping the benefits of a universal basic income without spending more money than it already does on welfare. \nYang, the politician who built his campaign around a universal basic income, proposed a value added tax. 160 out of 193 countries currently have this tax in one form or another. That tax would take 10% of the profits from major technology companies like Apple, Google, and Microsoft. This would generate about $800 billion annually. This tax is a great way to get some of the money needed to fund a universal basic income program.\nAnother plan to fund universal basic income is a type of carbon tax. A  2017 study done by the Office of Tax Analysis shows that a $49 tax on every metric ton of carbon dioxide released would result in about $220 billion annually. This plan is an important one because it would in the long run discourage companies from producing as many greenhouse gases. Although no states in the U.S. have a carbon tax, British Columbia implemented one in 2008 that proved by 2012 to not adversely affect the economy and reduce emissions by 10%-15%.\nThe last payment plan this paper suggests is another one of Yang\u2019s plans. A study done by the Roosevelt Institute projected that a universal basic income would increase the economy by $2.5 trillion annually and create 4.6 million new jobs, that in turn would then generate $800-900 billion in additional tax revenue annually due to economic growth. With all four of these plans in place there would be at least $2 trillion generated to fund a universal basic income program. That is $460 billion more than the $1.54 trillion deficit mentioned earlier. \nBecause this paper has presented an effective way to pay for a universal basic income, the next step is to determine how to set it up best. Every person 18 and up would be given $1000 every month. There would be no condition on who gets it, from the poorest to the richest. It would also not have any restriction on what someone purchases with the money. The universal basic income would significantly reduce income inequality because Alaska was able to go from 30th worst in income equality to the 2nd best over 35 years.  Although that may seem like a long time, it is the blink of an eye when viewed historically and in the long-run any massive change like that is well worth it.\nCovid-19 has caused an economic crisis due to the fact that people are getting laid off from their jobs or cannot work from home. Now is the perfect time to start seriously considering a universal basic income. In addition to a massive corporate bailout program, the United States has already given a $1200 stimulus check to all eligible individuals and it is too early to know what effect that will have, but it is a step in the right direction. The next step is to keep stimulating the economy, and if the government quickly created a universal basic income like the one previously suggested, it would pump $4.5 trillion in the economy. Once everything passes it would create 4.6 million new jobs for people who have been laid off because of the shutdown and the associated recession. It would be expensive, but with the 3 payments plans it would certainly be possible.\nA universal basic income is something America needs right now. In the short term, it will help get everyone through Covid-19, and help get the economy back where it was before. In the long term, it will solve problems like income inequality and poverty. Opponents of a universal basic income claim that it costs too much and would create disincentives to work. However, this paper shows that generating the money necessary to fund a universal basic income program is feasible and multiple studies have shown that during universal basic income trials there has been no meaningful decrease in working hours or employment rates. It also makes no sense to think that a $12,000 annual income will allow people to avoid work entirely, as opponents suggest. Due to the many benefits of a universal basic income, and the fact that it is affordable, America should implement a universal basic income.\n\n\n\nBibliography\nAmadeo, Kimberly. \"Universal Basic Income, Its Pros and Cons with Examples.\" The Balance.
